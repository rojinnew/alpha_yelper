With all the ridiculous ""National ____ Days"" dedicated to superfluous foods like cheese doodles (March 5th) and stupid specific eats like cherry popsicles (August 26th), it's about time you stepped in and made executive decisions on something that is clearly getting out of hand.  Who the hell is rejoicing over a cheese doodle that isn't still living in their parents basement playing N64?  What if I choose to have a blue flavored popsicle on 8/26?  Will Destiny's Child come out of nowhere and start singing ""No, No, No""? 

October 15th is WIDE OPEN.  It's the officially the first day of Florida stone crab season!  I am sure you have sampled these incredible claws at a fancy dinner or two during your tenure as the leader of the free world.  You cannot deny that they are some of the most delicious crustaceans on the planet!

So in love with these claws I am, here is my proposal:

- 10/15 will be a federal holiday and be known as ""National Stone Crab Day"".  Even for vegetarians.   

- Instead of only celebrating the day with bullshit Facebook posts, I was thinking something more along the lines of New Year's Eve.  There would be fireworks, confetti, and instead of holding a glass of champagne, everyone will have a large crab claw from Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  They will bite in it when the clock strikes midnight.  

- I've already drafted letters to several high standing Nevada officials about closing Las Vegas Boulevard that evening to throw a parade that will end at Joe's at Caesars Palace.  Judging by my persuasive and emotionally charged message, I am confident this will be granted.  

- A live televised east coast party at the original one, Joe's Stone Crab, in Miami hosted by Ryan Seacrest with Pitbull as the musical guest.

- The dip for the crab is almost equally as magnificent and should be considered for its own day.  We could go with the extremely catchy phrase: Happy National ""amazing crab dip sauce from Joe's that is pretty much crack sauce and should accompany every single bite of claw meat"" Day!  


I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Philip T."

Sure, I can get dishes like yellowtail jalapeno, rock shrimp and black cod with miso anywhere now.  But there's special, fuzzy place in my heart for Nobu...it's where I lost my ""upscale sushi"" virginity all those years ago in Tribeca.  Every meal in any location has always been awesome and never has let me down.  Just like vodka!

This particular location is very pretty and the big cocoon-like booths look really cool.  Why are they still at the Hard Rock?  Does Mr. Hard Rock have nude photos of Mr. Nobu eating at Panda Express or something??   They also have the most expansive menu that I've seen from Matsuhisa-san, so branching out from the oldies but tasties was a must. 

Their version of hamachi kama was the best I've ever had.  Impressive in size, the heavy on the salt based seasoning and brick oven baked flavor was outstanding.  The yellowtail meat was so tender that it had everyone gnawing on the bones with bare hands just to get every bit.  The server almost lost a limb when he prematurely assumed we were done.  

After very little convincing, so minimal in fact that I think I exclaimed ""YES! THAT!"" while pointing at the guy as soon as he said ""chu-toro"", we got the daily special of the medium fatty tuna topped with truffle, crispy garlic and greens.  They were indeed a divine couple of bites that had me wanting more.  I love tuna more than life.  Even my car license plate says ""tuna"" in Japanese.

Nobu still delivers after all these years!"

Overjoooooooooyed!  

Sangria 2015: Frozen red wine accompanied by little bursts of fruit presented in a half bottle to be scooped with two little spoons.  This must be how Willy Wonka gets bombed while watching reruns of ""Friends"".  It was a terrific ""beverage"" to start the meal.    

Spanish Pizza: I love burnt cheese like nobody's business.  These geniuses of food made it the crust for heavenly bites topped with Andres' fantastic ""Jamon"" and ricotta cheese.  How much would a full on large pizza like this be?  $1000?  More?  Unreal.  What is it like to be the duke/duchess here?

Beet Gazpacho:  Appearing like a fancy French pastry sold at Jean Philippe, the intense flavor was pretty eye opening, not easy for an Asian guy :D  That they even pulled this kind of richness out of a beet, one of the most non-offensive, unassuming vegetables ever (the Greg Kinnear of veggies?) is beyond me.  The sorbet-like quality was surely a big reason. 

Iberico Chickpeas:  This gave me the satisfaction and entertainment of every Vegas show I've seen in the last year all in one bowl and in less than 5 minutes.  Through the spherification cooking technique, the garbanzo beans had an ikura quality to it where they would pop in your mouth with only slight pressure.  Mixed in with the rest of the ingredients (I may have blacked out due to culinary ecstasy when the chef explained everything), the explosion of tastes in each spoonful was otherworldly.  I was the last one to finish as I wanted to savor every bean to its maximum potential.  

""Empanada"": Foie Gras cotton candy gyoza.  Formed, pressed right before our very eyes and eaten by hand, the combination of the fatty duck liver, light candy sweetness and Corn Nuts (?!), was an incredible mix that floored me.  Sign me up for 100 of these.      

Brandida Bacalao: Salt fish chicharron topped with truffle.  The fish air foam the chef delicately placed on top of each our pieces was like a fairy godmother granting wishes.  Light, airy and amazing, this could have probably been finished in two bites.  I ate it like a rat and managed six.  Are the employee dinners anywhere close to the magnificence of this stuff?  I would wash dishes for free.

Fun, creative, and extremely delicious, I'd gladly go back in a heartbeat.  If forced to choose, I'd go with é over Joel Robuchon considering the similar price point and for overall entertainment factor, but you couldn't go wrong with either for a dinner and show all rolled up into one.  This was a fantastic meal for our 8th wedding anniversary.  We were lucky to get the reservation and our golden tickets less than 3 weeks out.

On a recent visit for my wife's birthday dinner, Andrea's continuously hit high marks, plate after plate after plate.  Yes, it costs more than Spring Mountain, but there's a quality of ingredients here that is unparalleled to most spots a few miles southwest of Encore.  

The ambiance is really nice - the cool lighting, upscale late 70's furnishings with accompanying music that dabbled into the 80's as the night went on made me feel like this was the kind of place to pregame before going to Studio 54.  Andrea Wynn's eyes all lit up behind the bar were strangely soothing.  The 3 cucumber/gin cocktails only enhanced that effect.

With a party of 8, we opted to go omakase family style.  The waiter asked for a per person price to adhere to along with any items we were not interested in (ah-hem....$9 miso soup) and then we awaited the surprises from the kitchen.  ""Seafood on Ice"" may sound like the worst ice skating show ever (ok,ok a gigantic oyster doing a triple axle might possibly awesome), but these treasures from the ocean were excellent.  The slow poached prawns were shrimp cocktail for kings, and the initial bite of the marinated bay scallop totally wowed me with its freshness.  Crab legs, oysters, Maine lobster and tuna poke made life even better.   

The ""Steamed Sea Bass"" was exquisite.  It started tender on the outside and got tendererererererer as you got to the center.  The ginger, garlic, mushroom, lemon and cilantro made for a simple but divine combination for such a fantastic cut of fish.  I bet Roger Federerererererer would like this.  Everything else was very enjoyable including the tuna+crispy rice, rock shrimp tempura, hamachi sashimi, sliced prime New York strip, adobo crab fried rice, and the Saikyo miso black cod among other items.   

It was impossible to say no to the Mt Fuji dessert.  I mean....how do you NOT take photos and videos of this behemoth of sugar as they pour the Bacardi 151 and set it on fire???  I found it to be a bit too alcohol-y for my taste, but totally worth the ""show"" factor.  It was a great ending to the meal.  Color me reluctant no more!"

Logical heads prevailed and our party of 4 was still able to sample quite a bit.  Oysters were mandatory and a great way to start the meal.  They featured 3 types (Fanny Bay, Bluepoint. Skookum) and while I could only tell which was which based on shell, they all went down the same way, deliciously.  The pickled peppers/habanero and wasabi cocktail sauces were my favorites.  Most spots only offer $1-$2 oysters for happy hour, but just like Lionel Richie, these guys are doing it ""All Night Long"", one of many reasons to be a repeat customer.   

The ""Caviar & French Toast"" with the crème fraiche was a nice little curveball to the palette.  The toast's warm, buttery softness went nicely with the rest and we even got more of it just to finish the order.  Other standouts were the ""Grilled Shrimp Salad"" with its excellent dressing and soba noodles, and the ""White Fish Ceviche"", which I was selfishly eating straight out of the jar by the end.  

A little piece of seafood heaven on the westside for sure.  I could envision myself overlooking the beach while eating their delectable ocean treats.  Luckily for everyone in Vegas, Other Mama is here, and hopefully will be for a long time."

The CCNS consists of a thick, rich, hearty broth that touches my soul like Louis Armstrong singing ""What a Wonderful World"".  It's easy to taste upon the first spoonful of this glorious curryness that it's not something that can just be whipped up.  Those chickens have been simmering in broth for hours, if not days.  The generous amount of meat in the bowl makes me love it even more.  

Not that there's anything wrong with their rare beef pho or those meat entrees where the grains of rice looks all cute and snuggled up under the canopy of a perfectly fried egg, but that's all vice president/runner up type stuff.

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the ""European Sea Bass"" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time."

I will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  

Like an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  

They don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon."

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's ""chapulines"" can be prepared sautéed either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

""Imperial Shrimp"" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entrée.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more."

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's ""A Thousand Years"" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their ""Black Bean Noodle"" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!"

Although it's a small place that can cater to maybe 6 groups total, it's like a really cool guy's basement.  That really cool guy happens to also be named Guy.  He recognized my wife and I instantly since we lived in the same apartment complex a couple of years ago and had neighboring parking spots.  Throughout our visit, Guy was super friendly, attentive and made us feel very welcome.  The big leather couches you sit on INSIST that you stay a while.       

We were informed that all their food was homemade so trying the falafel and hummus appetizer was an absolute must for me.  Their falafel rivals any other joint as the best in LV, crunchy outside and flavorful green inside.  I could tell right away that the hummus was homemade.  It tasted more like a super thick tahini sauce than your average hummus but I thought it accompanied the falafel really well.  I'll be sure to get it again.  We also got an order of stuffed grape leaves and a nice basket of freshly toasted pita.  Guy also hooked us up with a couple of pieces of baklava which made for a nice ending to the meal.

Hookah time.  Lots of choices and my wife chose their ""pina colada"" which was fine and tasted as advertised.  3 bricks would have been enough for 4-6 people to smoke let alone two.

Count on me as a repeat customer!  At the very least I'll order their great Middle Eastern food to go since they're open so late or we'll lounge out the next time my wife has ""the itch""."

With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  

I'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!

Then there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!

It's a good thing we got here a little before 6pm on a Tuesday because every table was taken in 30 minutes with even more people waiting to be seated.  I can't think of another 2nd floor plaza restaurant doing business this brisk except for Ichiza.  Good for them!

General Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.  

I also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?

This is Chinese vegetarian heaven!  They even do ramen for chrissakes!"

It's really refreshing!  There was also this whole underlying ""Eyes Wide Shut"" feel to the whole thing in a good way.   

Thanks to Edwin P, my wife and I were able see the 8pm show of ""Vegas Nocturne"".  I won't go into any details of the show but I thought it was terrific.  This is what I imagine vaudeville shows were like but with some added modern nuances.  If you liked Absinthe, you will like this.    

We hung out for a while in their ""music room"" which was fantastic.  I am not sure what genre to technically call the band but it was like an old school New Orleans band with horns playing modern hits.  One of the funniest performers in ""Vegas Nocturne"" belted out a psycho version of ""Blurred Lines"" that had everyone on their feet.  There were some really unique performers after her too.  

I had a chance to look at the dinner menu which looked great.  We definitely plan on doing that soon.  Caviar tacos, foie gras, steak and some really interesting dishes I fail to remember due to the cocktails.  Can't wait to go back!"

It is downright AMAZING that not only have they stayed in business this long but thrived.  When so many restaurants have come and gone since they opened, SKH has been consistently great for 5+ years and there really aren't any other businesses nearby that contribute to their success.  People come to this rinky dink plaza for their delicious food.  That's it.

I love their huge combo platter that's around $15.  You get salad, rice or fries, and just a mountain of meats.  Even though Armenia and Brazil are miles away from each other, I deem this platter (explosion!) THE POOR MAN'S FOGO DE CHAO ow ow ow ow!  You get lamb, steak, chicken and lula all in one box.  Sure it's not AYCE but congratulations to you if you can finish this whole thing in one sitting.  My wife and I split this.  It's also $30 cheaper than Fogo so double boom.

Forte was great!  Being open until 3am is a big plus.  Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)

The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.

We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the ""Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates"".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.

Our favorite dish was the ""Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta"".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :P

The ""Thracian Clay Pot"" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in ""Game of Thrones"" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the ""Bulgarian Mixed Grill"" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha 

We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.

Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!"

Well who said you can't hook up again when they're back in town???

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 6th anniversary with a nice dinner.   It had been a long time since we were last here and it sounded a lot better than going to Red Lobster.  The original plan was to dine indoors and admire all the wonderful, priceless Picasso art displayed around the restaurant since we sat outside last time.  The hostess informed us they had a table open outside and asked if we wanted to check it out before deciding.  The fountain show was going off right then and we gave into the temptation of the patio once again.  Screw art :)  It's one of the best atmospheres to dine in Vegas!  I can't say no!

You get one of two course choices, there's the prix fixe and the menu dégustation.  We ordered one of each with wine pairings and even though the menu hadn't changed very much over the years, it was even more awesome now than before.  I think I appreciate fine dining now more than I did 6 years ago but that could also be due to prescription pills.  

We're foie gras crazy people so that was one of the many highlights.  The foie gras au torchon is the way my wife prefers it while I love their ""sautéed steak of ""A"" foie gras"".  The tenderness, oil and fattyness of it all complimented with figs and pistachios is like having a mouthful of multiple orgasms.

The pan seared U-10 day boat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau is like the most perfect, hand picked scallop.  A pearl!  I try to eat as small a bite as possible to savor it all.  

You basically can't go wrong with any of it.  Why change the menu when it's pretty much perfect?  This also marks the first time I've gotten through wine courses without leaving totally bombed at the end.  I must be getting more mature :P

Service was A++ from beginning to end and they offered us an extra dessert dish to celebrate the occasion.  We had such a great time that we ended up being the last ones in the place!"

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the ""Seared Tuna Special"" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out of the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out."

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their ""over the rainbow salad"" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the ""Spencer Steak"" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.

The people working there will literally give you the shirt off their back!  My wife was freezing and our excellent server offered the manager's cardigan to wear during dinner.  Who does that??

We went with Chef McClain's Signature Menu for $89.  No wine pairings because I am usually too buzzed at the end to appreciate the flavors.  I started with the ""Wagyu Beef Tartare"" with crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg and dark chocolate.  Chocolate and beef isn't a combo I am usually down with but it was a fun twist that totally worked.  I literally could've had this as my whole meal.  The buttered and grilled sourdough bread complimented it perfectly.

My wife got the ""Foie Gras Brulee"" which was wow, wow, wow.  It was such a creative dish and a wild mix of flavors upon first taste but it just got better and better after each bite.  It's ok to lick the dish, right?  This could have been a dessert and I wondered if the chef ever considered that.  

I got the ""Australian Wagyu Sirloin"" for my main entree.  It was as tender as expected but I was ready to swap after having a bit of the 48 hour beef belly.  That was treeeeemendous and what I would go with had I done it all over again.  

""Gianuja Pave"" was my choice for dessert.  It's not often I get to try olive oil ice cream with basil jam.  That was a really excellent ending to the meal and kept up with the creativity of the experience."

If you have a ""cheat day"" on your schedule, you might want to make it a ""cheat week"" after ingesting all these glorious calories, saturated fat and cholesterol at one sitting.  We ordered a full Royal sandwich and the wee (smallest) Guinea pie which is really not wee at all could feed 3 Japanese people for lunch alone.  

I now know why The Royal was rated one of the best sandwiches in Vegas last year by LV Weekly.  I loved how they just made the Italian sausage into one huge patty layered with all this cappicola and mozzarella.  A total flavor explosion!  The Guinea pie was equally as awesome with meatballs, spinach and cheese, cheese, cheese.  I really liked the thick crust.  

We had no shot at finishing everything but they made for some great leftovers the next day.

Our server had some recommendations (maybe since we were taking too long making a decision) and the one we went with was freakin awesome.  The Sen Mee Kang Pou which was a homemade crab curry with thin rice noodle was a slam dunk for both my wife and I.  She said it was one of the best Thai dishes she's ever had and I have to agree.  If everything the waiter recommended was this good then I would have had him pick everything.  

We also tried the Miang Pou.  That was a lettuce wrap with crab meat, ginger, roasted coconut, peanut, chili, lime and onion.  Nice starter and I liked how the filling was arranged in the lettuce to where you get the crab and spice at the end of it.  It was kind of like an appetizer money shot if you will.  

The final dish was the green curry which I wasn't too into getting.  My wife always wants it but I was sure glad we ended up having it because it was terrific. The curry had grilled pork, bamboo shoots and eggplant.  The sauce was really good but the pork was cooked perfectly.  It was so tender and tasty that it made the whole dish for me.  That's a protein I never consider for Thai curry but I definitely would now. 

Sure they have all the usual items any Thai restaurant does but I don't think that's what you should come here for.  Pad Thai schmad Thai yaaawwwwwn.  Quail eggs, Chilean sea bass, lobster and some of the more creative dishes is what I look forward to trying on future visits."

Mozen was one of those place I've had bookmarked forever, mainly for their brunch but $30 for lunch seems very reasonable for such a high rated spot.

The service was top notch from the get go.  They were very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and even though we almost went a la carte, our waiter urged us to go with the RE menu since ""it's the best of what we offer"".  Who wants to pay more than $15 for Indian curry anyways? :)

The Benito box offered a variety of diverse flavors.  It was almost like a mini tour of Asia!  The box had chicken tandoori in a mahkani sauce, California rolls (with real crab), garlic naan, miso mustard sliced steak and the matcha tiramisu being the perfect ending for it all.  My favorite was the salmon crudo tartare.  The freshness of the salmon combined with the nice spicy kick it had was fantastic.  I tried to buy another can of this as it would've been just perfect being mixed with a bowl of rice but alas...

The waiter said he mentioned to the chef that they should offer this combination lunch daily and apparently he scoffed at the idea.  Perhaps too many dishes to deal with all the time?  It would rival Estiatorio Milos for best lunch on the strip if they did.  

We also had a terrific view of Citycenter during the meal.  I had no idea that many guys wore fluorescent tank tops on a Wednesday afternoon."

It's still a top notch steakhouse but if and only if you come in prepared and knowing what to order and not order.  

I've had the pleasure of dining here a few more times and this is what I can say for sure:

- Only go if you're ordering the riserva (call ahead), the dry aged bone in ribeye for 2 or the Florentine porterhouse for 2.  I usually go with the ribeye.  Sure it's more than the usual steak but no one should be coming here to pinch pennies.  Which leads to my next suggestion...

- Don't be a cheap ass.  Outback is at Casino Royale next door.  There's nothing wrong with being frugal but your experience won't be good if you're trying to do it here.  

- The sauces are a waste of time.  You don't need it if the steak is awesome.  

- The filet mignon quality has changed since they opened and I don't think it's worth ordering anymore.

- Think of the pasta as an appetizer to share among friends or just a pricier side dish.  They are not dinner entree portions and don't bother ordering it if that's your plan.  B&B is just on the other side at Venetian and you'd have a better experience there.  That being said, I REALLY like the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo with brown butter and get it almost every time I go.  The Spago is excellent as well.  

- What's even better than great meat for an entree?  Great meat for an appetizer!!  The PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA 'RISERVA' is heavenly.  One order is good for 4.  

- This isn't a very romantic spot.  The music is mostly rockin and the tables are positioned a little weird with that middle section making you feel like you're dining in a hallway.

I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed everything I've sampled.  They've billed their deal as the ""all night happy hour"" which runs Tuesday-Friday from 5:30pm to close.  

They have lots of great snacks and finger foods to munch on.  Each of them go for $6 with the duck fat fries being the only one that would fill you up.  The fries are huge and it might be the perfect fry for me.  But it's all about quality over quantity with these dishes.  The beef shortrib sliders have some of the most tender mini slices of meat ever.  I also like the crispy chicken wings a lot and also the beer battered shrimp.  

Drink specials include $3 PBR's because they're trying to keep it real and make Dennis Hopper happy in heaven.  They also offer several cocktails like the ""Whiskey Smash"" with Makers Mark, lime, mint and sugar.  My wife likes the ""Perfect Effen Drop"" which consists of Effen Black Cherry Vodka, fresh sour and creme de cassis whatever the heck that is.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable with the menu and very friendly.  

Happy hour bled into dinner the last time I was here as we imbibed a little more than we probably should have.  The bartender strongly urged I order the ""Harissa Glazed Lamb Shank"" and that was right on the money.  No knife was necessary for this perfect piece of lamb.  It was juicy, tender, almost fall off the bone awesome. It was accompanied with cous cous and raisins.  I could've used some pita and yogurt sauce if they had it.  

The clear star entree had to be the ""Lobster Pot Pie"" with truffle cream and vegetables.  We didn't have it but couldn't miss a few of the customers getting it.  The server rolls out this baby tableside while everything is still in the pot.  Then they cut the crust from the top and carefully separate the pie from the pot on to a large plate for a unique presentation.  That was $85.  I'll save that one for a different occasion."

Then there's the veal appetizer.  They slow cook the veal, bread it and THEN pan fry it!  What??  I'll have whatever the chef is smoking please.  Juicy, flavorful and crispy with some great cream sauce.  I would've taken this as an entree.

They really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza, sushi, and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas, lamb chops, ribeye, ramen, kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  

Avoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  

Bravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!"

I didn't know that was something Japanese did?  I think natto is super gross but I guess drowning it in rich curry sauce would be the most acceptable way for me to scarf it down.  

Most of the meat options are breaded and fried with the exception of the kurobuta sausage.  I got the pork katsu with cheese and my wife went with chicken katsu and cheese.  Both were excellent and terrific portions.  I also liked how they offered almonds, raisins, sweet onions and pickles on the side.  I'd never put almonds on my curry before but it made for great texture.  I ate a ton of onions since that went really well with the crunch and juiciness of the pork.    

I would like to see a few more options for curry including a straight up beef option and maybe an unfried chicken too but that's not a big thing.  Friendly service, Japaneezy atmosphere and great curry is what will ensure my return.  Free wifi is a plus."

I have been to every other place in town and Gordon Ramsay Steak is #1 with a bullet!  Carnevino? Botero? Cut? Stripsteak? Old Homestead? They've all taken a backseat.

Longer review:

I made a reservation a month in advance for my wife's birthday as this is probably the hottest restaurant on the strip at the moment.  We had heard so many great things and were already foaming at the mouth as we circled the faux Arc de Triomphe.

The entrance was cool.  Is this what modern London restaurants look like?  I wouldn't know since I'd just eat Indian if I were there.  All the hostesses looked like they were ready to redo Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" video at a drop of a hat.  Now that everyone under 25 years old has no idea what I am referring to...on to the food!

We had drinks at the bar while we waited for the table.  I got a gin martini which was accompanied by a very tasty green olive stuffed with bacon and cheese and the wife got the ""English Garden"" cocktail.  That was a terrific drink as well and very refreshing.  The Ipad cocktail menus were neat to zip through and certainly beat flipping pages.  

Finally get seated, order a bottle of red and the wife goes with the ""Sonoma Farms Foie Gras"" with strawberry jam, bacon bits and buttered slices of English muffin.  WOWOWOWOW!  I've eaten some duck liver in my life but never like this.  Whoever came up with this creation deserves an award!  I'd like to have this for breakfast 3 times a week.  How many points is this on Weight Watchers?  

I went with the ""Maine Lobster"" which was stuffed with chorizo, poached in butter with cream and corn.  That was great as well but all I wanted to do was trade it in for more foie gras.  

My wife always gets filet mignon so I was prepared to get the beef wellington but she threw me a curve and actually went wellington.  I knew that the famed butcher Pat LaFrieda from NYC provided all the beef cuts here.  Great meat for sure but we had been to Old Homestead not too long before and thought it might taste kind of the same.  How freakin wrong I was!!  I was ridiculously taken aback upon my first bite of the ribeye.  This is the same cut of ribeye that Old Homestead gets?  Really??  It was mindblowing how different it was seasoned and prepared.  I was in a beef trance and loved every bite.  My wife really liked the beef wellington and the one bite I had was scrumptious but I was too wrapped up in the monster cut in front of me to focus on anything else :P

We had the standard creamed spinach and mac & cheese for sides and both were done perfectly.  Service was A+ too.  Too full for dessert.  

Other notes:

- I stopped watching ""Hell's Kitchen"" a few years ago since it seemed like the same season every year but the winner from the most recent season started at the restaurant last week.  She was open to photos and autographs to whoever wanted them.  

- Ordering fish at a place that specializes in steak is like ordering a hamburger in a Chinese restaurant.  I don't get it.

- Don't forget your Caesars Entertainment players card.  You'll save a wee bit on dinner."

It was Monday night and we were the only ones in the dining area at 8pm but that didn't stop Mrs. Q from greeting us warmly.  

Bobby had a seat with us and gave us the breakdown of his place and a little history behind their whole operation.  I hadn't done their food truck since I pretty much don't do trucks and was glad to finally try the famous ""Sin City Wings"" and some mighty tasty dishes you can't find executed this well anywhere else in town.  The two of them run the whole kitchen on Monday nights, no other staff.  I thought this was great because they would make the food the best since they were the architects of the menu.  

Before our orders came out, Bobby gave us a sample of their brisket and ""OH MAN"" that was almost the highlight of the meal.  Hummanah hummanah I am getting this next time for sure!  We got the fried pickles which were great and also a big enough serving for 4 so those were our ""greens"" for dinner :P  Also got a pound of wings with the Bobby Q. and hot buffalo sauce on the side but next time we'll just get the wings tossed in a sauce.  The Bobby Q. sauce was pretty unique.  It was a lot more tomatoey than most and would've gone great with a lot of different things including burgers and even fries.  I didn't ask if I could buy a bottle but I will on a future visit.  

Shrimp and grits were amazing.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled and I am not a southern boy so I am usually not feeling the grits but I dug out every little bit of grit out of the jar it was served in.  

Then the dessert or should I say ""jarssert""!  Their strawberry jellocake with whipped cream in a mason jar was fanfuckingtastic.  So rich, sweet and the whipped cream was definitely homemade and perfect.  When Mrs. Q asked how it was, I asked her how many sticks of butter were in this.  She said no butter!  HOW??  I must find out the secret.  Wow!  We were floored.  

It's a great menu.  I can't wait to try more!"

I did the omakase and everything was great.  I plan on just getting the nigiri courses and then just ordering additional nigiri since that's all I want the next time.  Maybe an order of toro with a side of chu-toro.  

Make your reservation on Tuesday or Friday since they get their fish shipments from Tokyo on those days."

I've neglected Chinese spots with hanging meat for too long.  I used to eat this stuff at least once a week.    

The duck is also tasty but I recommend asking for a breast cut.  Some pieces of the thigh were straight up skin and fat.  While some people appreciate it, I am not one of them.  I also had their chicken chow fun which is something I'll certainly order again.  

The service is also pretty friendly compared to most Chinese places around but it's all about the pork!"

What a terrific way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning.  This brunch has it all from the character, atmosphere, unique brunch items and service.  I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. 

To say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my life and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. 

I did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. 

The sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.

The juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.

And on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  

4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  

Breakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  

You've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!"

It's not like there aren't enough 5 star reviews on it already:P  I've read them all, had this place bookmarked forever and it lived up to the hype!  Definitely won't take as long to come back here.  

My petite wife gets cold pretty easily.  Anyone else ever bring a snuggie to the movie theater?  So being seated on the terrace was the clear choice.  The sunlight, high ceilings and decor really transports you somewhere else.  The indoor dining area isn't too shabby either but this is where it's at!

Down to business!  The 3 course lunch for $20.12 was what we were here for.  

Appetizer:

My wife got the Greek meze plate which had tarama (creamy paste with fish roe), tzatziki (cucumber yogurt), htipiti (Greek feta dip, kinda like hummus), manouri cheese (like super creamy feta), olives and cherry tomatoes along with a side of pita.  Yum yum.  The tarama was the clear standout as it was the first time either of us had eaten that before.  I love fish roe and all things caviar.  

I shelled out the extra $10 for the grilled octopus: sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled with lemon and olive oil.  It was worth every....single....penny.  Grilled octopus has to be one of the top 10 meats of all time!  I cut the pieces even smaller to try and savor each bite.  

Entree:

And just when I thought things couldn't get any better...they DID!  The waiter and a lot of Yelp reviews stressed the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean bass) and it was so fucking good.  I could eat this for lunch 3 times a week for the rest of my life easy!!  A whole bass grilled up with lemon and oil was simple yet perfect.  I even ate the head bits and eyeballs for chrissakes!! 

My wife went with the tuna burger but it was pretty much carb overload at that point.  Between the second bread basket, pita from the meze and then the bun on the burger, she just went from the protein.  The tuna was cooked nicely.  I think there was an orange slice in it?  The zuchinni fries were great as well.  They added mint to them which had them take on a whole different taste than the usual way they're done.  

Dessert:     

Walnut pie with kaimaki ice cream was like a super spiced coffee cake and my wife loved the yogurt martini.

I am not so hot on the dinner prices here but I would recommend this lunch to anyone.  I am ready to go again!"

Not only do they have 400 different martinis to try out but they also keep track of the ones via customer card that you've tried before.  Let's be honest.  Who really remembers the quality of their martini after the 3rd one anyways?  $2 off all martinis and appetizers during happy hour (5pm-6:30pm) is a terrific reason to stay a while.  

Walking into Elements reminds me of some of the restaurants located in Brooklyn, NY of all places.  The close but comfortable atmosphere with the new cabin type look would totally fit in and thrive on Smith St or on Atlantic Ave.  Just ignore the fact you can see the Terrible Herbst gas station from the north side windows :P    

My wife got the ""Jumbo Shrimp Marnier"": shrimp wrapped in prosciutto di parma, Thai basil, orange juice, Grand Marnier, served on a bed of greens.  That was really done well and we both felt the shrimp almost had a lobstery quality of taste to it.  I can't remember the last time we had shrimp cooked with Grand Marnier so that was the biggest reason.  I might have to give this a whirl at home.

I got the ""Prince Edward Island Mussels"": sauteed with coconut milk, yellow masala curry, fennel, basil and white wine.  Mother of god!  Amazing!  The sauce was so out of this world that I asked to box it so I could figure out some way to eat it later (ended up having it with pasta which was great).  I hadn't eaten mussels in quite a while and this reminded why I should more often.  Curry and mussels were a magnificent combination!

They don't call the main course ""entrees"" on their menu.  They're called the ""main event"".  My wife and I hemmed and hawed for a while over them before settling on the mini pork osso buco for her and the crispy roasted duck for me.  This was a main event as worthy as Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage versus Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat.  Both came with sauteed veggies and an interesting take on sweet potatoes that kind of tasted like turkey stuffing.  I wondered if I was still in Vegas after my first delicious bite of the potatoes but then saw the gas station.  

The osso buco was tender and full of flavor.  They were cooked with thyme, red wine and plum chipotle and were excellent.   I almost never eat bird skin but the crispness of the duck coupled with the flavor of Maine blueberries and pomegranate juice left me no choice but to devour everything I could until the bones were dry.  

We even had room for dessert and a third martini.  The apple strudel was surprisingly light and flaky opposed to most I've had.  

Catherine and Jose Luis Pawelek are the heart of it all and make Elements as local as local can be.  Catherine is a terrific hostess and makes everyone feel at home while Jose is the master in the kitchen.  I plan on supporting this restaurant more frequently in the future, one martini and mussel at a time."

We couldn't start the meal with anything but the Jamaican Curry Soup.  Anthony M recommended we have it the night before along with pretty much every Yelp review and it was tremendous.  I would strongly consider just getting a large bowl of this with a side of rice for my next visit.  In fact, my wife enjoyed it so much, she ordered another bowl of it WHILE eating her entree.  Who backtracks back to the appetizer?

I got the oven roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl which was rich and filling.  The jerk spice was jerktastic and the portion was pretty generous.

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  

The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  

We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  

No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.

There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:

- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word ""stuffy"" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  

- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a ""Bon Soir!"" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.

- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  

- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.

- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!

- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!

3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone."

What a menu!  So many great sounding choices.  It was hard to narrow entrees down but it had already been decided pre-arrival that the herbal salad was a must order appetizer.  Thanks Lisa R for the raving about it.  What a tasty, crazy mix of stuff.  The #7 spice was a little over the top as it set my tongue ablaze but was a good burn for the wife.  I don't know what happened to my relationship with spicy food but it has cooled off considerably the last few years.  I guess I'm getting old.  I would've ordered a 10 spice a long time ago. 

I was worried since we ordered our curries with #7 spice thinking I would need to ask for a fire extinguisher.  I asked the waiter if I could get a 4 or 5 for the Kang-Ped Delight I ordered.  He said ""No problem"" but the only problem was that the server had our curries right behind him!  Thankfully the coconut milk made it taste like a 5.

The Kang-Ped Delight certainly was all that!  The curry had bamboo shoots, tofu, zucchini, baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and hot peppers, cooked in red curry sauce with coconut milk.  It was probably the best Thai curry I've had in recent memory.  I added soy chicken for $2 and it made this killer.  The best fake chicken I've ever tasted.  How did they do it?  I can't wait to try their soy duck and shrimp on future visits."

Thanks to My T. and others for such great reviews.  That made this a no brainer after cashing in some bet tickets at Red Rock.  

We started with the eggplant pizzettes which were 3 discs of breaded, fried goodness topped with pamesan, ricotta cheese and tomato sauce.  These were delicious even though $9 for 3 pieces seemed a little steep but not a big deal.  

Mediterranean salad was good enough for 4 people and was full of olives, olives, olives.  We felt it necessary to down a few more veggies before the pizza came out.

I never made it to Di Fara's in Brooklyn, NY but thankfully Mr. Demarco gives us a taste of what we've been missing out on.  WOW.  We went with the Quattro Formaggio with mozzarella, provolone, romano, white cheese and tomato sauce and it knocked my face off.  The crust was perfect.  If this pizza were a punch, it would be Mike Tyson's right uppercut.  

Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu when I'm back eating meat.  I might shop for some leather chaps while I'm at it."

I've been able to sample a few of the dishes here and have enjoyed all of them.  The standout appetizers would be the baby octopus, raviolo and calamari.  I had the Sunday Gravy pasta the last time which included braciole, sausage, meatballs and pork gravy.  Heart attack on a plate!  It felt so wrong yet sooooo right.  The Nove spaghetti, pansotti (short ribs, brown butter, hazelnuts, spinach) and veal Nove were also very memorable from past visits.  The dessert menu is decent if you actually have room for it.  

This would be a great place to take some first timers visiting LV since you could cover a lot they would want to see in one evening.  Just make sure to have dinner a bit later than usual so you can enjoy the festivities upstairs when you're full as a bull."

Everything looks great here.  I swear we're looking at the choices for a solid ten minutes everytime as the lunch crowd continues to ask us ""Umm..are you in line or just looking?"".  Then we do the same thing for dessert.  

The $8.95 lunch combo is great bang for your buck.  You get your choice of a soup (usually more than 5 choices), sandwich (baguette, croissant or panini) and drink.  The baguette sandwich is HUGE.  They cut it into quarters and could easily feed 2.  I'm still trying to perfect my ideal panini but prosciutto, swiss, onion and mustard did me fine.  

My wife loves the quiche.  We've tried the four cheese, veggie and bacon and the mushroom.  To have one of these everyday would be amazing.

We always try to save room for dessert and usually split a tart or some kind of cake.  Eclairs, black forest cake, assorted macarons, fruit tarts..I feel like I'm on a game show and need to make a choice asap.  But alas I shouldn't feel pressured! I will be back for more!!"

In my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger ""all the way"" is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.  

On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.

My wife and I have done many an omakase at Sushi Roku with Kiichi creating so many amazing dishes so we were positive his very own restaurant would be a smash.   

I lived in Japan for 2 years and the atmosphere here is definitely one of the top 2 ""feels like I'm in Japan"" places in LV with Ichiza being the other. All the dishes you would expect from a kissaten are here so we dug in.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissaten

We started by splitting the chef salad which came with a great dressing along with a complimentary side of macaroni gratin. The gratin was so tasty! It was like one the best mac and cheeses I've ever had. We were actually scraping the burnt cheese parts on the side of the bowl. 

Entrees were the hamburger steak and tororin omelet (see pics). Both were excellent with a couple of twists to the dishes I hadn't had before. The hamburger steak was mixed with rice instead of bread crumbs and still worked awesome. The ketchup on the omrice wasn't your typical bottled stuff and complimented the fluffiness of the eggs and the oh so good chicken fried rice. 

Dinner was a little late for us so we didn't have a chance to try the pudding or chocolate parfait desserts since they were out by the time we were done. Just another great excuse to come back! 

I'm not a coffee drinker but this is a must go place if you are. Siphon coffee is this whole crazy process of coffee thing I'm unable to explain but you got to check it out. My wife was able to try the hot and iced and loved them both. There's quite different flavor to each of them. 

The chef mentioned he's getting a full liquor license which will open up a whole new bunch of menu options including serving dishes that go better with alcohol.  This place is going to get even better in the future!  

Good lord..how long is the wait going to be for a table here in 6 months??  I cringe.  We better go back asap."

Along with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and ""kobe"" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal.

I also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must.

Assuming the tasting would be kinda like Fiamma where it would be a set thing...the server informed us that they didn't have a seasonal menu anymore.  So we could pick any 2 tapas, split a Seablue salad, filet mignon and sea bass for entrees and then we would figure out dessert later.  Sounded a-ok to us!!

The naan that came with red pepper hummus, spicy hummus and a feta dip was a welcome surprise over the traditional bread/butter bowl.  It was really hard to tear ourselves away from it realizing we had to pace ourselves if we didn't want to just box the entrees to go without taking a bite of it.  

If they're letting us choose the tapas...OFCOURSE we're picking the most expensive ones!!  The prawn cocktail ""a la minute"" was 5 perfect shrimp poached in ocean water on a bed of seaweed and ice.  The poaching gave it a real nice tenderness to the prawns you normally don't get in a cocktail. 

Next appetizer was the lobster fritter.  3 kinda corndoggy/kaboby deep fried pieces of lobster with bacon and an upscale mayonnaise type sauce on lettuce.  I could've eaten at least 10 more.  That good.  Really!!

Seablue salad was nice and light.  The serrano ham and radish gave it great flavor.

Entrees were great.  To our surprise, we both preferred the filet mignon over the seabass.  They also gave us 2 sides..crushed potatoes and steamed spinach.  Totally unexpected!

So...much..food...what's the smallest dessert you have??  Profiteroles...rocky road ice cream in a chocolate crusted nut ball.  WOW!

The seasonal menus were priced at $49 per person but we ended up getting almost $150 worth.  The entrees still tasted great 2 days later :)

My only gripe is that this is listed as a ""romantic"" restaurant.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  Too loud, kinda cramped and the music fits group dining over couples."

Glad we did!!

The food was tremendous.  The prices aren't that bad either.  Not the most romantic restaurant..much better for a group.

Before I get into the food..I have to mention how good their Comme Ci cocktail is.  They got a whole prohibition cocktail thing going on which is all the rage but the Comme Ci was the real deal...totally refreshing.  It was some kind of cucumber, lemon and pepper thing with white rum.  I can't wait to drink these on their balcony during 100 degree weather.  They are $15 though so I gotta try to figure out how to make these at home.  

Appetizers:

Salade Frisee aux Lardons: Warm bacon vinaigrette, poached egg

Our awesome waiter, Keith, mentioned the French eat this salad at home.  If this is true...I'm inviting myself to every random family dinner the next time I'm in France!!  I couldn't get enough of the cured bacon with egg yolky goodness covered over everything.  

Steak Tartare: Coleman Ranch beef, capers, cornichons

I had never had Steak Tartare prepared the way they did it.  They mixed the beef in some kind of mayo/horseradishy sauce and it was so fn good.  I could've eaten this as my main course.

Entrees:

Crispy Skate Grenobloise: Haricots verts, lemon, capers, brown butter

BEST SKATE EVER!!  Nothing else to say.  

Duck Confit: Pommes Lyonnaise, braised red cabbage

Not like I eat duck confit very often but a lot of restaurants seem to use duck breast for it now but duck thigh is really where its at!  Super juicy and flavorful.

Dessert:

Chocolate Pot du Crème: cardamom crème chantilly

Like the best Nutella ever.  

There are so many other things I have to try on the menu.  They also have daily specials along w/ raw bar."

2 free dinners consisting of the seasonal menu course.  I've only been to the one in NYC years ago.  Kinda crazy we've never gone to this one after living here for quite some time.  

My wife and I just shared everything and it went down like this:

Antipasti:

Caprese w/ Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Baby Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil: 

The creamiest buffalo mozzarella I've EVER had.  It almost had a cream cheese quality to it.  Incredible!

Crispy Calamari, Peperoncini, Zucchini, Fresh Lemon, Parsley:

I really liked how the deep fried all the ingredients (sans lemon) with the calamari.  Gave it a unique flavor..the fried parsley really works.


Secondi:

Ravioli alla Fiorentina filled with Fresh Ricotta and Spinach, Butter and Sage Sauce:

I'm usually not into cream sauces for pasta but this was excellent.

Organic Free-Range Chicken, Wild Mushrooms. Fingerling Potatoes, Natural Chicken Jus:

I have a hard time ever justifying paying more than $10 for any chicken dish anywhere but we got this since it came highly recommended by the waiter.  Outstanding!!  I would actually pay $20 for this dish.  And I usually peel the skin off chicken for health reasons but it was a must eat for this dish.  I'm salivating just thinking about the flavor of this dish.   

Dolci:

Pastry Chef's Dessert Sampler:

I was honestly high from chicken at this point so I don't know exactly what the trio was but one was like a chocolate ice cream bon bon, some kinda flan and tiramisu.  It was truly struggle to finish dessert since we were so stuffed but we managed somehow, some way :)

Couple of glasses of wine and cucumber martinis really put the bow on this dinner.  The regular menu looked incredible and might be back next week!!!"

You could easily spend $100 by yourself.  The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....

How can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.

My wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???

The waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.

Best creamed spinach ever (Peter Luger's being #2).  We went on a pretty slow Thurs night so our waiter was cool enough to bring us several samples of the huge wine list they have there at no charge.  I imagine very few places are better than this downtown.  You can't go wrong with this place!!

We started with a seafood sampler dish which consisted of cocktail shrimp (with cocktail sauce, garlic sauce and a creamy hollandaisish sauce),  2 large stone crab claws and the best crab cake we've had in Vegas.

Both of us went with rare filet, I opted for the warm center and she got the cool center (hardcore..if she could order it raw..she would!).  And the lemon cake we got at the end was delicious but could've been good enough for 4 people!

Excellent service...basically everything good anyone else had to say about the place.   Wonderful!"

One thing my wife has been commenting/complaining about has been the lack of quality bakeries off the strip.  Well...she plans on coming here at least once a week now.  We just went with the baguette ($1.40), a cinnamon roll,  and a mixed bag of bagels.  The bagels were just ok but I am spoiled after living in NYC but the first 2 were fantastic.  I guess I am going to have to start running more often!"

If I am here with 4 or more, we usually just go with one of the dinner sets on the 1st page of the menu.  Great value and you get A TON of food.  Something is seriously wrong if you ain't totally full after that.

I am a sucker for fresh squid so that is one dish I always order if it isn't a group outing.  I've been happy with everything I've ordered there."

We always end up spending about $100 for 2 (those Hite beers are light, refreshing and easy to blow through) but if you bring 6 people, it only ends up being around $200.  

Its comedic to have a large groups of people eat here cuz even though it seats six, its like a puzzle trying to figure out what food goes where on the table and it actually promotes eating faster since you need clear plates to make space for the mackerel, bibimbap, and that 3rd meat plate you ordered cuz you didn't think 2 was enough but it was.  

And to top it all off, you get that nice ""beef cologne"" scent from all the bbq that lasts on your clothes for at least a day.  I've always felt like the aerosol spray market was pigeonholed into just flowery type stuff and it could be big business to sell such scents as ""Korean BBQ"", ""Apple Pie"" and ""Mcdonald's French Fries"".

Service was great.  Its interesting in the US that the staff has to grill the beef for you as opposed to places in Korea and Japan.  I guess that's just a health regulation thing making sure some crazy person doesn't eat the whole plate raw or super rare, get sick and then sue the damn place.  

Anyways, I like this place a lot.  The best Korean BBQ I've had in Vegas.  I've never been here before 11pm and I like it that way."

I wished they had a deeper beer selection like Pabst and Natty light but that's about it."

Its a pretty limited menu consisting of $11 prime rib and $5 breakfast plates along with turkey and roast beef sandwiches.  No $5 special.  So call ahead if you're going on a Monday.

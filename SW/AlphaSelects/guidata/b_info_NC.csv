Same great beer selection, amazing fish tacos (of which I will argue are the best in town), and that killer Secret Pizza Menu. Definitely worth a gander if you've never had a chance to do so. 

The factor that makes me want this location in the ATL is the disc golf basket out front. Not only is it a perfect distraction for the kids to go out and play, but it's a great way to kill some time al fresco with a beer in hand. Really love what they've done with this spot.

It's nice. Like.....really nice. For the concept, I can't think of any other branding that has as much attention to detail as these guys. The place is just pretty and easy on the eyes. The aft entrance is so slick with all of the different kinds of signs and angles. A brand/company that adjusts their look slightly based on the location typically has a good eye for their customer base. Good show, ladies and gents. 

We got our most recent meal to go and it was my first time doing so. It was such a stellar experience. My wife called in our order, for 6 hungry mouths mind you, and they gave us pickup time of 15 minutes. We arrived almost exactly 15 minutes later and there our food was in one bag. Done.

My take? It's the shining star in a sea of dying breeds for truckers, blue collar, and white collar alike. It's the kind of place, on the local level, that you want to have memories of. You need to experience a burger wrapped in paper and eaten at the dirty, standing room-only, picnic tables. You need to experience the ""line"" during the lunch rush. It's a timeless favorite. 

Would you know about Brooks from reading some hip, haute cuisine magazine? Absolutely not. You're either going to stumble across the reviews and hear about how it's a stellar burger stop with great fries or your friend's grandma's church member's daughter used to go when she was a kid and you have to try it. 

It's a dive and it's utterly perfect. My only regret is that I didn't get my burger all-the-way -- chili, onions, and mustard. That sounds like heaven. 

Do yourself and everyone else a favor and go have your own experience at Brooks."

The place is really clean and has great attention to detail. Plenty of tables, booths, and ample seating at the (sushi) bar. We grabbed a booth and our server promptly took our order(s). 

We forwent apps and went straight to entrees paired with a few Sing Ha beers. Ordered the Pud See Ew, #2 spicy, and chicken. It was fantastic. Those wide noodles are executed so perfectly and retain such a unique and smoky flavor. The #2 level of spice was enjoyable and served up a balanced twinge of heat throughout. About the same as a moderate helping of Sriracha. 

My wife ordered a veggie dish with the same wide noodles. Can't remember the name, but the flavor was so peppery. I'd order that myself. 

Our server is was really rounded out our experience. She was so, so, so friendly and explained the menu thoroughly. 

5 solid stars for this Thai joint. I'd head back in a heartbeat. Only wish it wasn't all the way down in Ballantyneland."

Came in on a Saturday before noon. The space is still being outfitted and decorated, so it has a bit of a feel leftover from the previous biz. I couldn't care less. The magic happens behind the counter and in the kitchen. 

The high notes:

Pupusas -- If you've never tried a pupusa, you're missing out. Thick, fried dough, veggies, cheese, and pressed flat. Incredible. It may look small, but don't be fooled. It's filling. 

Arepas. Filled with shredded chicken and some of the tastiest veggies I've had in a long time. The chicken had a flavor that was mild, yet pungent. The juices that came from the chicken, which I'm assuming was made in a pressure cooker, permeated the bread and almost made into two separate items. It didn't last long on my plate. 

Empanada. The crispy dough filled with even more cheese and veggies was equally amazing. Textbook execution. 

Tacos Autenticas. Perfect. Chicken, white onion, cliantro. That's all, that's all you need. Perfection. 

Guac. What else do you need to know? It's GUAC. I'd eat it every day of my life. The chips are seasoned, too, which is a nice touch. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Sabor. I'm excited to see how it builds out and becomes more of an Elizabeth staple. I'll be back soon. Next time: Burrito."

Same old liege-style waffles, happy staff, hotter than lava and delicious coffee. So, so, so, so happy to see these guys expanding the brand throughout Charlotte. 

If you haven't experienced these waffles, make a trip. Hell, make two trips. I love that they have the bottled cokes made with real sugar. One of my go-tos if I'm not in the mood for coffee. If you're planning your maiden voyage for CIW, go for the naked variety. It'll give you a good idea of how to build on the basic waffle.

This location is located right next to George's in Piedmont Row. Parking in the garages or on the street. There is a bit more space than the location in Blakeney. Enough room to do a victory dance after enjoying a waffle, no doubt.

Wait....Let me reiterate that -- I LOVE BREAD. Adam, owner/Chef, makes some killer breads. Namely, the Pecorino Romano blows my mind every time. We've taken home a few loaves, I've had it on the Cuban sandwich, and we've even paired it with some chili at home. Stellar execution on that recipe. 

Now serving breakfast and lunch -- the menu is tremendous. Can't speak too much to the breakfast items, but lunch is wondrously perfect. I've had the Cuban and the veggie sandwich. The Cuban is heavy, packed with tons of great stuff. Love the pulled pork and the lighter pickles. The mustard concoction is so complex and makes for a flavor dynamic that keeps your palate on the edge of your seat. Served on the Pecorino Romano alongside the clam chowder -- winner. I loved every bit of it and it was a great lunch. The veggie was equally legendary. Whatever that corn spread is brought tears of joy to my eyes. 

Also love the cooler packed with fun bottled sodas -- Sunkist, root beer, Cheerwine, and others. 

Focus: Bread, bread, bread. There is so much love, thought, and expertise put into every loaf. Do yourself a favor and pick one up next time you're at the market."

I'm a sucker, I know, but Viva exudes all of the aspects of a staple in town for a quick-service resto. It was pretty astonishing to learn that this joint is totally Charlotte-based. 

There are so many things that gave this experience 5 out of 5 for me. 

Service: Holy cow. The woman at the register was super helpful. She gave me some background on everything I had questions about. I'm a firm believer that the more questions you ask, the more likely you are to find out what you'll end up loving. The gentleman working the line was equally helpful. He gave us some background on the housemade drinks, Inca Kola (tastes exactly like bubblegum, by the way), other processes, Peruvian cuisine, and the back story. They give you a number if you dine in and bring your order to your table. They were even so kind to spell everything out, give some info on flavors of the different Aji (sauces), and came back to ask how everything was. Top notch service indeed. 

The flavors. Oh, my. First, The Great. This is the staple chicken sandwich under this roof and it's a force of culinary nature. It all starts in the ""Green Oven"" they have straight from Peru. It's a rotisserie/grill hybrid that gives the chicken immaculate flavor. Imagine pulled, tender, juicy chicken with charred flavor and absolutely no compromise in texture/chew. I was astounded. It is served on ciabatta with red onion, tomatoes, and a spread of some sauce. Add avocado and provalone. You won't be sorry you did. 

The yucca and plantains were top notch. Dunked heavily in the Aji Amarillo and the green Aji sauce. I'd eat these with every meal. 

We also ordered the avocado stuffed with quinoa. Sounds odd, looks odd, tastes AMAZING. Balsamic is a nice touch. Don't be scared. Just try it if it's your style. 

The alfajores, shortbread cookies with dulce de leche, are incredible. Coated in powdered sugar and only beckon a tall glass of milk. Buy them in two or four packs. They make these suckers in-house, too. 

Inca Kola. Loved it, so interesting, can't wait to have it again. Ever wondered what a liquid version of Bazooka bubblegum would taste like? Here ya go. 

Prices vary on dishes. Some of the entrees are a little more pricey (as expected) and the sandwiches, sides, and apps are a bit more modest in price. Definitely a little more pricey than some, but you can get out the door with a meal under your belt for between $10-$15 no problem.

The whole experience was awesome. I loved all of the background on the concept, preparation, kitchen, etc. Such a nice dinner and I'm already planning a menu for my next visit. That chicken is just too damn good to not be in my life. Viva...Viva Chicken indeed!"

Upon my visit last night, I was astonished at my lack of review. Well, as they say, better late than never.

I've been a patron of Lang Van for years and have never had an experience where the food, service, and company have not been unique, memorable and utterly satisfying. The owner(?) or manager is one of the friendliest people in all of the Queen City. Regardless if you visited this week, late 2012, or even 5 years ago, she'll remember your face. She'll come up to you and give you a hug, welcome you, ask how your family is, and then hastily launch into bringing you a menagerie of Vietnamese foodstuffs. 

The menu, which is not for the faint of heart, houses an abundance of options. I used to order anything with coconut curry or just the simple Pho, but the owner (I really need to remember her name!) simply asks me what I'm in the mood for, proceeds to list options -- ""What do you like? What do you want? Do you like crispy tofu? Do you like noodles? Coconut Curry? Vegetables? Meat or no meat?.....Ok, I'll bring you something nice."" --------- THAT is why Lang Van is an incredible experience every single time. Not even seeing a menu anymore is a dream come true. 

Recently, I was introduced to Vietnamese coffee. Check out my photo or some of the others. It's an experience to be had. Condensed milk, a small urn of drip coffee...strong coffee above a tall glass with ice. Truly amazing. 

Lang Van is a staple in Charlotte's Vietnamese dining scene...nay. Overall. If you're even close to the line of wanting to try Vietnamese cuisine, start here."

My kind of spot for a good breakfast or any time, for that matter. It's like a Common Market met a grungy record shop and then decided to focus on bagels. I just love this place. 

Parking can feel a bit odd since there aren't many spaces out front and it's so close to South Blvd. I'd park where ever you can find an open space. 

The menu is extensive with tons of crazy concoctions. There are plenty of more breakfast-style choices but tons that will appeal to the lunch bunch as well. My favorite for an anytime or good breakfast -- Mary's Grubby Bubby. Tomato, avocado, egg, and muenster. I was stoked to see they had some bialy left, too! Tried it on for size and it was amazing. I love making bialy at home and Owen's really hit the spot. 

Though I didn't grab a cup of coffee with my breakfast, the roaster they use out of Raleigh had bottles of cold brew in the cooler. Love trying new cold brews and loved that Owen's had this for sale. Picked up a bottle on the way out. 

The service is great. Homeboy was nice and took care of like 6 people after I ordered mine. That guy had some hustle, too. He then came out and took care of the entire room while everyone was eating. One man teams like that are hard to come by. My hat's off to you, my friend.

We skipped the drinks this time around, but they had a rather extensive wine menu. The focaccia and pesto they start you with is phenomenal. I'm a huge proponent of good focaccia and Fiamma's recipe is perfect. I barely have words for how good that pesto was. Fresh, aromatic, and strong. The smaller breadsticks in the bread basket were a nice touch as well. 

Entrees were stellar. I stepped out on a limb and ordered the veal chop, which was the special for the evening. Side of gnocchi and a killer red wine reduction. The veal chop was tender and packed with flavor. Stuffed with spinach and onions and each bite was better than the last. While hugely different than what my typical order would be, I was very pleased. The gnocchi....man. So good. Subtle, chewy, sweet with the tomato sauce and fresh herbs, and a perfect combo with the chop. I'd order that as a side dish again in a heartbeat. 

What really set this place apart from other eateries was the service. Our server was one of the most professional I've had in a long time. He knew the menu like a second language and offered great input. Also, being served some comp limon cello at the end of a meal is always a nice touch! Great flavor and super strong. 

They also had live music while we were there. The guy had some serious talent and really set the mood. Really looking forward to heading back in for a special occasion or date night."

I have to say that I was absolutely shocked at how good AZN was. Made it in for lunch, somewhat late in the afternoon, and there were only a few tables filled. We were a little leery of what was to come, but I couldn't not give this place 5 stars after our experience. It's pretty rare to have an experience that really delivers on all fronts, but AZN pulled it off. Even on a slower afternoon. 

Started with miso soup, house salad with ginger dressing, and some of the veggie dumplings. Miso and house salad are pretty standard. Just right. The veggie dumplings were just great. So simple, a great combo of sauteed veggies and a fantastic ponzu/soy sauce for dipping. We actually ended up ordering a second order (which never happens to us). We were pretty hungry. 

I ordered two rolls of sushi. Really simple -- California and Spicy Tuna. Both were fantastically easy and familiar. The presentation was hilariously cool. On a plastic bridge with some art made of sriracha. Check out my photo. 

We ended up ordering dessert, too. (Again something that doesn't happen often) and it was nice. Tempura Cheescake. Pretty much what you would expect. How could you say you don't like fried cheesecake? I don't know either. 

Ended up coming in again for lunch soon after and got to sample a menagerie of other menu items. Started out with the Firecracker and Enter The Dragon rolls. Both are much more complex, but incredibly flavorful. The Firecracker was by far my favorite. It's pretty pricey, but well worth it on occasion. Sashimi isn't something I'd typically order, but AZN's sashimi sampler packs a punch. Amazing cuts of Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. Love the arrangements and a nice bonus of a Cali Roll, too. The ceviche was great, too. Light, citrusy, and a mixed with a healthy portion of veggies. 

The decor isn't overbearing. Not over the top like some other sushi places I've been to. I think what I love the most is the seating choices. Booths, bar, hightop, tabls, upstairs, sushi bar, private dining area. So much space and really gives you options for each visit. 

Service is very professional and attentive. Each server I've had was polite and incredibly patient. Big plus. 

Definitely my go-to for sushi when in Southpark."

The rice paper rolls - best I've had in Charlotte. Very thin vermicelli, mint leaves were spectacularly fresh, crispy tofu and the peanut sauce was just wonderfully flavorful. 

Had to sample the pho, per usual at any vietnamese eatery, and I was thrilled. Simply put, it's just perfect. Savory and smooth broth, spiced well, filled with crunchy scallions, bean sprouts, fresh jalapenos, vermicelli, and a nice helping of thinly shaved beef. 

Two entrees and rice paper rolls for only $22. We'll be back really freaking soon. So good."

However, this time, our most recent visit was of the dinner/evening variety. Saturday evenings in Southpark are not typically on our radar, but we ended up meeting some friends and we were thrilled with our experience. 

We made a reservation for the evening on the patio. The weather was great and live music was filling the patio. We had a seat in the rather quiet and intimate setting on the patio. The patio setup they have here is so great at night. Much more quiet than you would expect. We ended up ordering some drinks, but then the weather took a turn for the worse. We asked our server if we could switch to inside whilst waiting for our friends. She happily obliged and scored us a great seat in the large dining room. 
A great courtesy without even batting an eyelash. 

I ended up ordering the cucmber gimlet and loved it. I switched for bombay saphire gin and enjoyed it very much. A nice cocktail to sip throughout the meal. 

The bread they served pre-meal was focaccia and it was fantastic. A nice change from the standard pretzel bread (which is divine). 

One aspect of their menu that is so attractive is the adaptability for vegetarians. My wife had no problems with the menu and if she wanted something sans protein, they were happy accommodate. Thanks for this!

I ordered the new ""Nacho"" brisket burger. This is the first time I've had a burger med rare in Charlotte and the second time I've had a burger made from brisket. All I can say is WOW. The flavor of the beef was so intensely smokey and well-balanced with guac, onion straws, jack cheese, and that incredible brioche bun...A homerun for sure. Glad to see these guys are not joking around with their burger(s). I've had the Wagyu burger on occasion and I've always left happy...and so full. It's definitely not a burger for the faint of heart. 

Another small not, but huge props for having Northcoast Scrimshaw in a bottle. My favorite Pilsner and so stoked these guys typically have it. 

Dear Zink,

Thank you for your incredible staff, accommodating dining areas, flavorful menu, miraculous beer varietals, and adaptability. 

Sincerely,

Ben."

Had the pleasure of checking these guys out at their launch and whilst getting boozy at Triple C. Brian, owner, and his staff are churning out grilled cheese like mom used to make....and some mom has never even heard of. 

Gotta hand it the menu for these fellas. You can certainly venture for au originale or something a little more on the adventurous end of the culinary spectrum. Can't say there is anything better than a standard grilled cheese, but the varieties with pork, southwestern chicken, leek & mushroom, and the dessert option with nutella are certainly worth shaking a stick at. 

We all know a grilled cheese is best accompanied by soup, chips, or something comparable. Brian has you covered. Rosemary and truffle chips and the tomato soup are available to turn your sammy into a dynamic duo. Pair these jokers with beer from Triple C and you're well on your way to a fine meal fit for the streets of Crown Town.

Prices can seem a little steep at first, but do yourself a favor and talk to Brian or the staff about what kinds of cheese they're utilizing. You'll be happy you did. Also, they have Square, so those of you with no cashola, fear not. 

Catch these guys at a food truck roundup or chillin' at Triple C!"

You wouldn't suspect much out of this old mill turned bar, turned animal hospital, turned brewery, but the decor, service, adventurously ridiculous menu, brews, house-made sodas and potential will make you turn your head more than once. 

First, the decor alone will cause your jaw to drop. The layered wood lining the walls is just outstanding. The pattern it creates draws your eye to being the first thing you see. The main entrance houses a full bar and the booth seating has a gorgeous high back of finished wood. Looks like a dark cherry. Absolutely gorgeous. The chandelier is made of the extra brass pipes from the brewing gear with bullet holes blasted through them! So rad. You can bet that'll show up on pinterest soon....

Service is incredible. There are so many different places to sit -- outside deck, upstairs, main room, tap room -- and the servers ring it up and send it fast. Three different bars to order from, too. 

We ordered the i2PA and the red ale. Both are solid choices. i2PA is by and large my favorite off of the menu thus far. The oatmeal stout is is one of the better choices, too. Next time we're in, we'll have to order a few flights to check out the rest of the lineup. Blueberry Blonde? Sounds crazy interesting!

The menu is just.....insane. Not only from a perspective of fusion, presentation, and taste, but the story behind each menu item. Each item has it's own little quirk and style.

We started with the pretzels and spinach artichoke dip. The presentation of both is stupendous. Pretzels were a little on the firm side, but the beer cheese made up for it. Very nice flavor on the cheese. The spinach artichoke dip was lovely. Served with a flatbread of sorts, and housing huge chunky artichoke hearts. This didn't last long as we scraped every inch of the bowl. Would order both again in a heartbeat. 

 I ordered the Brewmaster burger. A mix of porterhouse and brisket. What? Who in the history of burger-dom has mixed porterhouse and brisket?! It was incredible. Served on brioche, the few standard burger accoutrement, and rosemary tots. These jokers are 2oz tots. Creamy, savory and chewy. The smokiness of the burger was to die for. It wasn't overt, but just subtle enough to inhabit my palate throughout the meal. 

My wife ordered the veggie sandwich. All smokey, grilled veggies on focaccia. A rather hearty sandwich. She ordered the creamed corn with it. Man. Talk about rib-sticking corn! Very creamy and huge corn flavor. 

We ended up ordering dessert as well. We had to sample one of the house made sodas! Went with the orange creamsicle float and the blondie. Both were knockouts. The house-made orange soda was incredible. I can't wait to check out the rest of the lineup. The blondie was just as it should have been. Warm, topped with ice cream, and plenty of rum-infused caramel. What a nice cap to the meal. 

Heist may still be new, but they are showcasing some serious talent all around. These guys hit every sense and beckon for you to dive deeper into the complex menu, both beer and food. These guys will grow and continue to show Charlotte something it has never had before. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Heist!"

The shop is small and quaint with a few small tables. I really dig the chairs. Galvanized steel and they are heavy as hell! There are some shelves with health food items ranging from dried veggies, fruits, chips and even popcorn. 

Onto the juice. We ordered a grapeberry and a kale mint. The kale mint is divine. Perfect balance of apple and kale with just enough of a kiss of mint to be refreshing. The problem with kale is that it can be pretty bland. Their recipe really takes away the stink of the kale. Much appreciated. 

The grapeberry was perky, bitter, sweet and had a subtle strawberry flavor. It really grows on you sip after sip. The color is brilliant pink, too. Very odd color for juice, but interesting. 

These guys also do smoothies and salads! If you're doing a juice fast or just really enjoy a healthy snack, these guys do it right. Thanks, NB! Cheers."

Holy eff...a flavorful creation that makes anything else I've ever had named ""chile relleno"" pale in comparison. It's not even fair. The breading they fry this thing in is perfectly soft, sweet, and mellow. So subtle, but the texture takes the lead. The chile itself is very mild. Stuffed with cheese and topped with a few different styles of salsas. I can't event begin to tell how magical the flavors are. It's one of their signature dishes and is easily the best thing on the menu. I'm pretty sure you can eat 4 of them. They are medium size and come with rice and beans.

Hanging out on a Saturday morning at the market is great. Tons of hustle and bustle. Hungry folks exploring the various vendors and stands. We enjoyed the morning crowd and had an early lunch. 

My wife ordered the mushroom on the sprouted ancient grain crust and I ordered the chorizo pie on the traditional white crust. The mushroom had incredible, robust aromatics. Local shitaki mushrooms and a nice whisper of truffle. The crust is thin and chewy with tons of grainy flavor. That subtle truffle oil flavor....heaven. The chorizo was great. I appreciated the lime wedge to squeeze over the pie. It added the needed sourness to enhance the other savory flavors. I enjoyed chorizo, but the mushroom definitely took first prize of the two. Easily one of the best craft pizzas I've had in the QC.

They also have some great drink choices. Ting? I haven't seen this except at Jamaican restaurants and ethnic markets! How cool! I LOVE Ting. I used to drink it as a kid. It's a nice, perky flavor and works well with the pizza. 

Price point is very fair for the craft they churn out, they bring the pizza to you where ever you are in the market, and you can even custom your pie to the world's end. I'm so stoked this place set up in the 7th Street Market!

Very much looking forward to going back. Cheers!"

We had played a round of disc golf down at Winthrop and were on our way back up I-77 and then *CLICK*. We were close to Wing King. The timing was perfect, the hunger was imminent, and wings were on the menu. 

On our way, we read a few other reviews and were a little iffy about dining in or taking out. We decided the full experience was necessary. We seated ourselves and grabbed our own menu and began to peruse the mountain of sauces available. Everything from teriyaki to crazy dry rubs. We settled on a large basket of fries with a side of medium sauce for my wife and 10 wings (5 Medium and 5 Honey Hot) for me. 

The fries are great. Krinkle cut with a subtle dusting of seasoning salt. The medium sauce....Textbook. It really does stick the the doctrine of ""medium"" and doesn't provide too much spiciness. Pungent flavor and well rounded with a buttery finish. 

The wings are evenly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and a good mix of flats and drums. I'm a big fan of the mixture as I feel flats tend to have more flavor and are more tender. The sauces work wonders on chicken. Goodness gracious. The medium will make any dyed in the wool wing-lover weak at the knees. The honey hot is something out of a romance novel. A sweet, succulent sauce that is thick like honey and has a slight twinge of heat. We even started dipping our fries in it! Usually 10 wings is too much for me, but I muscled through these bad boys with ease. 

I would have to say that Wing King lives up to the infamy. Wings that can turn my head and stay in my flavor memory are rare. I look forward to many visits to come!"

The inside is quaint and houses a small bar, a handful of tables and a few TV's. Not over the top with decoration. Just simple and direct. 

The staff was zipping around the dining area with multiple plates in hand. A wonderful Colombian culinary ballet was happening around us as we anticipated the arrival of our lunch. 

We started with the Tostones con Queso. Green plantains with queso fresco. Only 3-4 on the plate, but perfect for two to share. These things are topped generously with fresh, melted cheese. Chewy plantains and melted cheese? Might as well be a bullseye. 

I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana. A menagerie of flavors, textures and traditional Colombian dishes. The pork cracklin' was by far the most interesting item on the plate. Fried pork skin. It's like a high-five in your mouth. Like a chewy pork rind but succulent. It's a mammoth-sized portion. I'd recommend trying a bit. Eating the entire portion would be a bit much. The steak, egg and sausage were all fantastic. 

Here's the kicker. The herb mixes they bring to the table are the golden goose, the cheery on top, the KO punch and the holy grail rolled into one. Spices and herbs, olive oils that complement every dish rather well. Mixing each one in with the rice and beans....something I crave daily. Can't wait to come back in just for these. 

Lastly, the agua frescas are immaculate. We tried the piña (pineapple) and loved it. Served in a tall glass with many fresh chunks of pineapple afloat. Loved every sip/gulp.

Every seat at the bar was filled, all of the high-tops, the lounge areas and pretty much every table. Definitely one of the premier places to check out. 

The art throughout the restaurant totally makes you think twice, buffalos and cherry blossoms, really strange lamps, incredible ornate wing-shaped lampshades over the bar and sweet mural of a $5 bill in the upstairs. The best, by far, is the steel tree near the hostess stand. It really stands out and blends well with the rest of the decor. It doesn't stop there. Check out the ceiling tiles. The ENTIRE book of the The Art of War is painted on them. Yep. I said it. You'll have to see if for yourself. So crazy. 

We started with the pirogies and goat cheese with spinach. Both were fantastically flavorful and perfect for a table of two. Pirogies were almost like Indian samosas with the spices inside. The dough was flaky and had a slight chew. The pea mixture on bottom was to die for. Definitely both worth getting again!

Wow. 5Church still has me astounded and still trying to find the right words for the ""60-Second"" Steak. I can barely describe the difference in texture from rare steak to crunchy, crispy and perfectly seared bottom. Each bite was a perfect savory balance hit with the tangy, malty, barbecue-y steak sauce resting at the bottom of the plate. I don't order steak, pretty much ever, but this has stolen my steak-loving heart. Goodness gracious, it was incredible. A fantastic NY Strip. I'm still having daydreams about it. 

The staff hoofs it. Up the stairs and then back down. Huge trays, drinks, server books...they never stop moving. All with a smile and very knowledgeable.

When I say simple, it's in the best way possible. Not glitz and glamour for Z's. A few simple murals on the wall depicting a map of northern Africa and most of the Mediterranean...and that's about it. It's all about the food here. Just how it should be. 

The staff is very kind. Even courteous enough to ask if you've ever ""experienced Mediterranean food before"" and walk you through the different preparations and choices. Much of which can vary slightly, but always good for a refresher. 

Onward to the meal! My wife got the Falafel platter. Perfect orbs of crispy outside and warm, soft, flavorful inside. Not dry and also not overly moist. Topped generously with a mix of veggies and fantastically mixed tabbouleh. Finally! A place that uses bulgar wheat! The pickled veg was incredible. 

I ordered the mixed platter. All three skewers they have with a dashingly colorful salad and pita/hummus. The chicken by far has the most flavor. Charred bits from the grill and marinated in something that fell from the heavens. The lamb and beef skewers also retained a ton of flavor. All of the spice mixtures are pungent but not overpowering. Perfect balance from three equally delicious animals. 

The place is clean, busy, simple and has flavors that will make you think you're chillin in Tel Aviv. Can't wait to go back and get the Shawarma platter!"

The small parking lot directly in front of the restaurant can be a bit wonky. Especially if traffic is bad. There is additional parking across the street, so keep that in mind. 

I'm a huge proponent of a great greasy burger, baskets o' fries, and an ice cold PBR. Pinky's delivered on multiple fronts and the 5 stars goes to show for a slew of positives. 

Vegetarian options. Holy crap, this place has it all. Veggie chili, veggie burgers, dogs....They know how to make it on the map with Charlotte's veggie pride. I was blown away by Ding Dong style. Peanut butter (crunchy), sriracha and honey-cilantro slaw? Might as well be a bulls eye. The textures and flavors make it into a faux Indian/Thai wonderland of flavor. Each bite was better than the last. 

Pimp'n Fries. Whoa. You can customize these in so many ways. The ubiquitous pimento cheese reigns supreme on these bad boys. Pimpin my taste buds like it's their job. 

White Trash Burger. Duuuuude. Onion rings on a burger? Sign me up. Messy, greasy, piping hot and perfect rep for the dive bar world. I'm going for the double next time. 

Tons of goofy stuff on the walls, awesome booths for two, plenty of space and a vast menu of dive-y greatness. What more could a hipster ask for?"

Each time I've visited, the beer selection seems to have grown or something has been added that wasn't previously available to the human race. 

The walls are lined with plaques from local Pro Beer Drinkers. You can register your beer-capades and work your way up to earning your own plaque. Sounds like grounds for a great DYL, am I right?! 

I've enjoyed most every nook of this fountain-esque beer haven. Great outdoor seating, cozy inside seating and the bar is long and hospitable. Here's a tip: order the pretzel. Oh, man. I can't think of a better pairing of food/beer. Salty, warm, chewy, soft pretzel with melty, melty cheese. Throw in a tall German beer and it's like being 21 all over again. What a treat. 

This is the premier establishment to grab a craft or import beer north of Uptown. Can be overrun with UNCC students and other beer fanatics. Sometimes difficult to find a table for large parties. Absolutely love this joint and always stop in for a quick brew if in the area! Cheers!"

The bar has tons of local beers on draught. NoDa, Birdsong, OMB, Natty Greene's, and plenty of others. If the weather is poor, from rain or sweltering heat, take a seat at the bar and rest your frosty glass on the ice rail. Yes, it's like a gift from the beer-filled heavens. What an incredible and innovative idea. It keeps your beer icy and gives the kids something to play with!

The food is grade A bar food. Grilled pretzels with beer cheese, brats, dogs, and wings. The best things we've had have been the hippie nachos. Complete with crumbled blackbean burgers and nacho cheese. The fried banana peppers are to die for and are great on everything you can get your beer-drinking hands on. The pretzels.....oh, sweet lord. Amazing. I've been hard pressed not to drink the cheese at times. Salty and perfect consistency. 

I love that this place is kid friendly. Sure, there's tons of booze flying by and it can draw a bit of a rougher crowd, but take the kids in for a hotdog on the patio at lunchtime and it's better than a ballpit. Tons of games for the kids to play out back and the staff is so friendly. The bartenders were giving the kids straws and other things to play with on the ice rail at the bar. How nice is that? Definitely a plus for those who have little ones and had to forgo a sitter. 

VBGB is a perfect afternoon spot for a beer and brat. Great to watch the game or have a patio lunch with the fam. High-fives all around!"

This place excels on a level of Italian procurement that hasn't accurately or sufficiently been defined by the culinary world. Located off of Providence (and a bit difficult to squeeze in and out of their faux parking lot) it's the neighborhood shop for all those seeking to attain the level of ""savant"" in preparing their pasta-laden meal(s).

First of all, the staff is so friendly it hurts. They genuinely are interested in what you are preparing. They aren't trying to shove a $200 wheel of Parmigiano into your shopping bag. They want to help you acquire the flavors that you're looking for and, without a doubt, they'll have what you're looking for. Have no idea what to prepare? They do. Ask one of the staff members for a recommendation and they'll hook you up with the starch, protein or mise en place to pull off a meal like Mario Batali in a super hero cape. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the smell. Breath deeply, newbie shoppers. You'll breathe in the fresh garlic, herbs and fresh pasta being prepped in the back. What a treat and right in your Myers Park backyard. 

I've ventured in on several occasions for dried pasta and other canned goods (pepperoncini peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc) but you can't beat their fresh pasta. They have over 10 different kinds in-house. My favorites are the garlic rosemary or the wild mushroom. Sampled a few of the others and they are all wonderful as well. All are ideal for preparing ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti or any other pasta dish you're looking to make. 

This place is a market titan for its class. Wonderful selection, staff and overall presentation. Look forward to visiting every single time!"

There's gold in them there walls. Lovely, Serbian and Italian culinary gold. That's right. I said Serbian. You're in for a roller coaster ride of freshness and delight. 

The location rests off of 10th street and accessed from Central. Pull into the gravel parking lot and sit in the small dining area or on their glorious patio. Stays cool even in the summertime! 

Intermezzo is a small staffed joint that makes everything in house. They don't even have a freezer! They make their own phyllo, mozzarella and salad dressings. It doesn't stop there. Ask your server and they'll be able to tell you ad nauseum on how many fresh items are being churned out of that tiny kitchen. It's ridiculous. 

So, feeling a bit nervous about trying Serbian cuisine? Never fear! Order the Burek and thank me later. Phyllo filled with cheese and spinach or ground beef. It comes with a house salad, the balsamic reduction and small side of tzatziki-ish cucumber salad. Each bite of the Burek is tender and savory. Mix up the flavors! I take each bite with a bit of salad and the cucumber mixture. Everything swirls with happiness. 

Best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had. The marinara and ricotta work together like old pals. My goodness these guys make lasagna like I've never had. Out of this world fresh flavors and packed full of zucchini, squash, onions, tomatoes and other veg. 

Bruschetta. All I can say is GET IT. House made mozzarella and fresh bread, tomatoes, basil. Need I say more? 

This place packs a punch with their small bar, too. Tons of local beers and plenty of mixed drinks for you to pair with your meal. Great wine list as well. What Italian joint comes sans wine? Not this place. 

If you haven't made it into Intermezzo yet, you're in for a treat. One of the Charlotte gems that you'll frequent on the regular. Cheers!"

How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good. 

A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately. 

For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal. 

We started out with the Roti Telur. ""Pancake"" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!

My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce. 

I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate. 

Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy! 

The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department. 

Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon. Cheers!"

I had long wondered why I was never a huge fan of Italian cuisine. Too many experiences of overly-filled plates of pasta with heavy, sweet sauce I suppose. My negative streak was meant to be broken here! Vivace has tuned my palate to the finer side of Italian eating. These guys have a killer location in Metro and their space is coveted by many. Juxtaposition alone lands them a whopping high-five. Hello, greenway and view of Uptown. Little did I know before my visit. 

We stumbled in on a lazy afternoon for a 3:30pm lunch. Perfect timing for a quiet meal on the patio. We had one of their over-sized umbrellas all to our selves with a glorious Uptown backdrop. We weren't even aiming for romantic but it comes standard on the patio. Huge fan.

Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. Took into account the weather (rather hot) and recommended some refreshing appetizers and drinks. Greatly appreciated his recommendations. 

I ordered a Limon Cello. Fresh lime juice, triple sec and soda water. Here's the breakdown on the ""Cellos."" Not an instrument. Nay. In fact, there are several choices and all made from fresh fruits and juices in house. Quite impressive and the freshness doesn't lie. 

Apps: Bruschetta. Holy wow. This is the best bruschetta I've had in the Queen City to date. Perfectly balanced with fresh bread, sweetness and fresh basil. The tomatoes are smoked in house. Yes, I said smoked. The flavor is incredible. Comes with six 1-2 bite pieces. Each should be savored and perhaps taken from your fellow diners if they aren't paying attention. I was tempted to lick the plate. Incredible flavors swirling on each crostini of joy. 

Cheese Plate. Man. What a treasure trove. We chose all 6 cheeses to try. Served on a woodblock with bread, honey, an apricot marmalade and a cranberry chutney-ish jam. Each cheese had it's own interesting note. Spicy, sweet, fermented, strong, mild and so on. No combination was incorrect with the jams and honey. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. 

Entree-ish: Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The dough was thin, chewy and served as a perfect catalyst for the rest of the flavors. Fig spread, Gorgonzola and arugula danced very lightly on my palate and complimented one another nicely. This pizza was great. The proscuitto was only on half since my wife is a vegetarian but it was great. Mild and salty like it should be. 

Dessert: Pistachio gelato. Creamy and choc a boc filled with pistachio pieces. Served with a biscotti. I only wish there had been a few more pieces of biscotti since it worked so well with the gelato. 

So glad to have tried Vivace finally. Looking forward to heading back in the near future for a further look into their pizzas and greater entree selection. Cheers! (or, Ciao!)"

Cast Iron Waffles is churning these things out like they're going out of style and each one is a hit. 

My wife stumbled upon this place and fell in love immediately. Resting at the base of a town home in a strip of other small business (Connected to the same shopping center as Wings and Rings and Blink off of Ardrey Kell) it's a perfect little bistro-esque location for breakfast. It may be a bit difficult to find for first-timers and actually find a parking space (you can always park in the bank's parking lot) but the location is very quaint and houses tons of personality. 

For those of you who appreciate waffles, you may have to dash the idea you have in your head. These are Belgian Liege style waffles. They aren't pouring batter into a piping hot waffle iron and handing out faux eggo garbage. This is a brioche type dough that is hand-pressed into a waffle iron. Filled with tons of pearl sized crystals of sugar, each bite of waffle is crunchy at first, bursting with sugar crystals and finishes with a brilliant chew. Be prepared for intrigue as many waffle aficionados tend to be. You won't think ""waffle"" immediately, but rather ""sweet bread."" The owners have put a lot of thought into how these are prepared and their dough is no joke. 

There are different choices of toppings ranging from whipped cream, fruit, nutella, maple butter and powdered sugar. There are the occasional seasonal options on the menu but I have yet to be impressed by any. My recommendation is go au naturale. Just plain waffle to see what your taste buds will be up against. If you're looking for an added sweetness, go for the maple butter. Not too overt with maple flavor and just the right amount sogginess to add to those chewy waffles. Many of you may consider this spot as more of a ""treat,"" than a breakfast joint. It all depends on who well you can handle the sweetness of the dough. 

These guys also do coffee and espresso drinks. None of which are a draw and pale in comparison to the lead singing waffles. 

One of the coolest aspects of the shop is the old school coke machine they have in the back. You have to get quarters from the register and then open the door to the fridge-style vending machine. Note: You have to pull your bottle of coke out REALLY fast for it not to lock down on your bottle. Ask one of the employees behind the counter. They'll be able to tell you more. 

Cast Iron Waffles is a must for anyone in the Blakeney area. The business owners are great to chat with and love to hear their customers' stories. Ask to hear theirs. What a great family. Love how they are operating this little joint. 

Hear, hear for Belgian Liege waffles in south Charlotte!"

Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. 

The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. 

The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. 

Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sautéed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. 

Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were ""Dos"" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. 

Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. ¡Ole!"

However, it has been kept in immaculate condition. Definitely go explore both the 1st and 2nd floor. Lots of cool things to see. 

The mini bar in the foyer is so rad. Only a few seat, one bartender, a small tv. Quaint and perfect. 

We sat inside since it was a bit chilly. There is some outside seating, which would be fantastic for a spring/summer dining experience. 

Apps: Apple Beggar's Purse was one of the most decadent and sought after dishes of the evening. Savory, sweet and addicting. The thyme butter sauce will make your taste buds deliriously happy. 

Escargots were fantastic. Best I've had to date. Tender, garlic-filled bites of once shell-inhabiting morsels. Worth the try if they'll be your first. 

Entrees: Lamb Chops were amazing. Cut was thick, flavor was smokey and rich. Cooked to perfection. 

Ok, so I'm not typically a filet kind of guy, but The Fig Tree made me shut my skeptical mouth. Veal demi glace? Are you kidding me? WHOA. Also, topped with amazing cheese and a mushroom mixture that was sining in the foreground of your pallet the entire time.

Throughout the entire evening, service was professional, kind, witty, fun and helpful. Great staff. They hire and train well. These people know their stuff. The way it's supposed to be.

Their Injera is perfect. Put the fork and the knife down and sop up all of that good lentily mixture! 

If you are of the carnivorous group, plenty of beef options. Ethiopians tend to stick with beef since it is more plenty. Not too crazy about the meat options, but definitely interesting and always worth the adventure. 

The service is so nice and very friendly. If you're not sure what to order, (Shiro Wat would be confusing to most, I'm sure) they are very helpful. Don't be afraid to ask. They know most people aren't familiar with Ethiopian. 

If you choose to take leftovers home, be sure to keep your Injera separate. You want it to retain that nice and boingy texture!

This place is a Charlotte staple for sure. Talk about a great dive with tons of history. 

Nice and simple menu with a couple choices of burgers and a few different kinds of chili. Let me say, the chili is what will keep you coming back. The choices are variations of Cincinnati, Southern and Texas style Chili. All have their strong points and are even good when mixed together. The only one I can't truly appreciate is the Cincinnati style. Sweetness in my chili is just a bit weird as a dyed in the wool southerner. 

Sweet tea. You've gotta get Lupie's sweet tea. Sweetened to perfection and they give it to you in a mason jar with the best crushed ice in the world. A perfect pairing for your chili of choice. 

The burgers are great, too. I haven't ventured into the world of burgers too much, but what I've had has been memorable. 

The parking lot can be a little tricky. If you're going at peak lunch hours, good luck. It's a bit cutthroat to find a space. Also, getting back out on to Monroe can be a bit of a challenge, so beware. 

This place is awesome. Love it for lunch or a date night with my wife. Actually went to this place with wife the night we decided to get married! Such a great memory. 

Keep doing exactly what you've been doing all these years, Lupies.

Never a dull moment for this plaza midwood hearth. Always a pleasure to visit.

Only difference between this location and plaza midwood is the outdoor seating. Gotta love those nights out in southend sitting outside. Another perk? There's an apple tree in the courtyard. You can pick the apples and eat them! There is usually an apple picker next to the tree, so pick some when they're ripe! Really fun for friends and family visiting from out of town."

Must say that this is our go-to spot in Plaza. You really can't go wrong with $1 PBR every night of the week. (Hipsters UNITE!)

The staff has always been so kind and willing to get to know us as regulars. Derek, Justin, Telley, Jenny, Sunny and Jessica are always smiling and busting to make sure everything is running shipshape. 

My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here and Bryson did an amazing job serving our group of close to 50 people. One server, one room. He conquered it. 

I've had my last two birthday parties here. Flawless as well. The private dining room is awesome. You can shut the doors and make it more intimate for your group. Great option. 

Been to many a catered event here as well. They have a great system down. 

The Food: You can't really find a burger on the menu that you won't like. (I recommend the cuban, running machine or the pocket press) Recently tried the sliders and they are rockin'. 

Wings are awesome. Head over on Wednesdays for $.50 wings. Great flavors. Especially crazy about Barbalo (Buffalo/BBQ)

Definitely one of our staples in the QC. Can't believe I'm just now writing this review."

Like I want this in my life every day good. It's a simple menu of only a handful of choices, but I have no doubt every single item is delicious.

This is because my pork sandwich, with apple jam and a perfectly crisped kale chip on top was pure heaven. The side dish of green beans, ricotta, apple jam and egg was the perfect pairing. To top this off, I had the most delicious vanilla lemonade. 

One thing I will note is that this does not come cheap. The total was $22. Honestly, it was totally worth it. But if you're looking for a cheap lunch, this is not your place.

The decor is GORGEOUS too. It looks like that home decor magazine you subscribe to and want for your own. Exposed brick, herringbone hardwood floors, marble tables and exposed beams. 

That's it. I gotta go once a week to feed my craving!"

The bar is beautiful and the drinks are a work of art, thanks to the master behind the bar. If you don't get a cocktail here, you're really missing out. The most inventive one I've seen is the Ruby Queen, beet juice at it's best, spiked! And my favorite so far, the Manhattan. 

It's really all about the seasonal produce and interesting ingredients to give a dish personality and flavor. The first time I came here I ordered the heirloom total salad, which was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be, with some playful twists. The golden tomatoes dill and sweet corn mixed brilliantly together. And the fermented cherry tomatoes were such a great and unexpected element of an already awesome salad. 

For an entree I ordered the crispy chicken breast and leg. I NEVER order chicken in a restaurant because it always ends up dry, but I seriously trust that Chef Curtis will whip up something incredible here. I was not disappointed in the least. It was tender chicken, lightly breaded and not over-coated by any means. The bread portion came in the form of dirty bread pudding with a corn puree that I wanted to lick off my plate.

The second time again I ordered the Butter Poached Walleye. Every single item in this dish was drool-worthy. the walleye was excellent, the green beans and fingerling potatoes were a great accent but the saffron dumplings were the icing on this cake (don't even get me started on their popcorn panna cotta...soooo good!!!). 

I've actually only eaten in the bar area so far. First night was PACKED and admittedly a little too loud (am I old??). But my second time I hesitantly sat in the bar area again and the noise level was totally fine. I could hear everything my friends were saying... unless I was too busy stuffing my face.

I can't wait to keep coming back and seeing what rotates on the menu seasonally. I imagine each time will be just as good as the last, if not better! Get ye to Station, stat!"

They, being Richard Deshantz and Tolga Sevdik, owners of Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye. I'm not joking when I say they've got this down to a science. Cook awesome food, offer a hip environment, great cocktails and you win.

I've been there a handful of times already, always sitting at the bar. Why? Because their cocktails are killer, yes, but also because I never think to make a reservation, which you must do at least two weeks in advance (maybe even three if you want a weekend date). 

It's TINY, like really tiny! half the size of Butcher and maybe offering about 20 tables. So that's why you have to wait for a table and make a reservation. But TOTALLY worth it! The taco's aren't priced too bad, in my opinion. They're hardy and you get 2 for around $10ish. My fave so far... the mushroom taco. Sounds weird, but it was so delicious. The best way to experience a mushroom in my opinion. So good... I seriously dream about this taco! 

I've also had their gauc, which come in various forms that you can choose from. I went with the classic, and while it was good, it's a tiny portion for around $8. I probably scooped half the bowl on one chip, which is partly my fault! 

I'm excited to finally sit at a table soon, so watch out for a full dinner recap soon!"

I've had their smoothie, which was awesome (the chocolate one!) and I've had their Acai Bowl, which is my go to breakfast item. Plus, you can't beat their always friendly and warm staff.

I'd love to see this place open earlier for coffee/tea and a nice place to work and have meetings. They currently open at 11am, but have a full juice and espresso bar, so I'd only imagine (and hope) that it's a matter of time.

We pretty much sampled everything on the menu, but since it's small plates, you get a chance to taste a lot. And truly, that's the way to go here!

We started with the Cured Seafood plate with cold smoked tuna, beet cured salmon, shellfish sausage and a regular Charcuterie plate. The charcuterie was incredible as always, with the duck being my favorite choice. The Seafood plate was really different, with the sausage being my favorite flavors.

We split the:

Lamb Steak with sauteed greens, heirloom beans and balsamic
Smoked Duck with cornbread, hohirabi and radish slaw, strawberry bbq sauce
Chicken Meatballs with soy and ginger sauce, serrano, sesame, fresh egg yolk

I'm torn between the lamb and chicken meatballs being my favorite dish. The chicken meatballs were just perfect, moist and bursting with flavor. The lamb was cooked medium rare, which is the only way to have it, and the beans... those buttery tasting beans, complimented the dish so well! The duck and combination of strawberry BBQ sauce may have been my third fave. But it's hard to rank them when they're all really fabulous! 

Chocolate Pot de Creme just finished off the meal perfectly. Not only does Chef Kevin cure meats well, but he also makes incredible chocolate dishes! I've had the chocolate cake before and and it matched the amazingly chocolate goodness of this one. And this is coming from someone who's not even a choco-aholic! 

It's BYOB, so bring a bottle and enjoy one of the best meals in the Burgh!"

I'm such a sucker for a place that has a theme that carries throughout. They obviously put a lot of thought behind how they wanted the place to look and feel. It looked like a lot of the wood was reclaimed from barns, you know, that kinda hip look right now? Are they calling it barn chic? Who knows... but I do know the food was gooooood!

I'm way into cream sodas and was so excited to see them, plus you can spike it with vodka... DONE! It was delicious too, with the seasonal flavor being pecan. The only thing wrong was that it went too fast... my bad!

We started off with the warm olives and mozzarella, which was good and made me want more! The crab balls were good and I think if you're really into crab, this will probably be your jam. The poutine was the only thing that was so so. The fries were legit fresh cut, but the gravy sank all the way to the bottom and wasn't very plentiful and the curds weren't very melty. This was probably the one item that was just okay. But I kept eating, so you know it was fine!

I wanted to get just the saucy balls aka 4 meatballs. But I thought you could choose different balls and sauces (this sounds so dirty... but how can I not make this sound dirty??). But you can't do that. No ball switching allowed! SO I went with the sliders instead because you're allowed to pick your balls freely...

I got the:

Meatball Sliders were $3.50 each
Classic beef with Sunday Gravy
Spicy Pork with arribiatta 
Chicken with creamy parmesan

The best by far was the chicken with parm. I really thought I would have been down with the regular classic beef, but man was that chicken ball good! With the creamy parm it just paired amazingly. The Spicy Pork was my second fave, with a spicy arribiatta sauce to go with it. The Classic was still good, but the others just blew it out of the water!

The service was super friendly, and I was surprised to see it so dead, but it was a Saturday afternoon with not much going on downtown (other than a weird anime conference at the convention center). I will note that I loved their serveware! Stainless steel deep bowls with handles. It made serving and eating easier. I know that's a weird thing to notice, but I loved them and kinda want them for my kitchen now. Don't worry, I won't steal them..."

Could this be one of thee most underrated restaurants in Pittsburgh? It just might be, so please get here and get ready to be blown away because it really blows up and you end up not getting a reservation!

It's little unassuming corner joint, but when you walk through the door you're pleasantly surprised by the calm atmosphere. The aesthetic was very clean, with glowing tea lights and cream shades covering the windows. The service was just impeccable too, as our waitress was friendly and open to us asking questions about the menu.
 
We started off with one of their specials, the Mackerel Mousse with homemade pepper crackers. I was a little nervous having not tried something like this before, but since I'd read past reviews that said to get it, I trusted my fellow Yelpers! Good thing I did, because it was incredible! The mackerel was a perfect whipped sensation, sprinkled with some bright orange caviar. But, let's talk about the homemade pepper crackers... That tasted more like shortbread cookies. Man were they good, and our waitress kept bringing us more! It was a treat that I never wanted to end, even at the beginning of our meal!

I took a quick glance at the top of the menu, which advertised the bistro as ""American comfort food."" Let me tell you, it's comforting to know that you'll be 100% satisfied leaving here! The menu is small but it was one of those times were everything looked enticing. 

My mind was made up pretty fast, as I zeroed in on the Noodle bowl. It had Beef/lamb meatballs, pho broth, cilantro and coconut noodles, shiitake and kimchi for $22. Let me tell you, the flavor of the broth, the homemade coconut noodles and the meatballs, the most amazing meatballs, made for one incredible dish. This meal just rocked my pho loving world!

And it didn't stop there! We just had to go for a delicious homemade dessert. The layered Russian cake was devine, with a honey cream layered between soft cake. The server talked it up, but didn't do it justice until you took a bite. And, she had made it herself that day... Adorable, right? 

I'm just so won over... Seriously, go here, and go here now! I cannot wait to come back and share this hidden gem with the masses."

While I enjoyed the Rosemary Braised beef more, because I love horseradish and caramelized onions, the Carne Steak was just as good! The steak was so flavorful you didn't need anything else... 

Unless, you're into sauces like I am! I love sauce! They had four different kids of sauce on the table in the middle of the place. I wish I could tell you what every kind was, but all I know is that they were delicious! I just wanted to steal them and put them on everything I eat all the time!

Next up was the main meal. I don't know how I could possibly decide, as everything up on the chalkboard menu looked tantalizing. I'm always wary of ordering anything other than pancakes or french toast for brunch, because it's usually always a good thing (and my fave brunch items), but the hash just looked too good to pass up. Especially a hash with brussells and bacon. So I went for it.

And guess what? It was stellar! Probably the best non-pancake/french toast brunch I've ever enjoyed. EVER! It was mixed with onions, peppers and packed with flavor. With two massive eggs over easy and a delicious toasted piece of bread, I was trying not to lick the plate.

It's not across the pond (well maybe a river or two), but right here in good ole Pittsburgh. You may get great fried fish during Lent around these parts, but now it's year round here!

I had to go with the classic order for my first time. The fish was undoubtedly fresh and the deep fry was crisp and surprisingly not greasy in the least. I really enjoyed the fries too. You know those fries you kill for? The ones that are so crispy and perfect, you almost don't need to dip them in ketchup? Almost. These are them, yo! I had a couple bites of the mac n' cheese as well. Love the big noodles, but it could have been a little bit creamier. 

But I didn't stop there! Remember, gluttonous? So I tried the oatmeal toffee chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. Do I even need to say how amazing it was? And with freshly baked cookies? AND ICE CREAM. 

And the apple pie tasted straight outta yo momma's oven. We got crafty and scraped half the ice cream off the cookie and made ourselves an a la mode pie. Desperate fat kid times, you know? The fried mars bar was a warm melty fried mars bar. Was it delicious? Yes. But the other desserts are just made with homemade goodness, they'd be hard to avoid!

Yep, this all happened. You read it here first. I wasn't hungry until 9pm that night. When I ate an apple. Which was boring and lame."

So the guy, who I'm assuming is an owner or manager of some sort is nice enough to help me out. That was pretty much the only option I had, to trust him, considering there's literally no menu. None.

It's really weird walking in here for me because I was in the spot when it was a flower shop. I worked right next door at the Starbucks and was friendly with the staff. But the transformation is incredible! It's really beautiful inside and surprisingly fits a lot of people. Probably because they've also opened up the upstairs as well. 

With dark wood and intimate lighting, it still gives off that old world charm, but has a modern twist with a fancy pants bar both upstairs and downstairs. With the absence of the Mt. Lebo patio, this spot has a more urban feel, which I also like. 

The hubs and I split the Quattro Formaggi (Fresh mozzarella, fontina, asiago, gorgonzola, pecorino romano, extra virgin olive oil) and the Diavola (San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh spicy salami, calabrian chili pepper, pecorino romano, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oilmozzarella) pizza. Both were equally delicious, but I think I favored the Diavola more. I liked the red sauce and slight spiciness, but it wasn't overpowering, which was great for me. Although the Quattro was also fantastic and super cheesy. It was unlike any pizza I've had before, which is a good thing.

Be prepared to take a while to scan their extensive wine list. I usually recognize a handful of names, but here I only recognized Chianti. Thankfully our server helped us pick out a tasty wine (crap, I forgot it... it was red...). 

Make sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekend, because they get packed! I'm so happy to have this joint in town now. Although it will be hard to avoid when I'm down there now. I just want to stuff all the pizzas in my mouth!"

The hot dog. Check. The toppings. Double check. The Bun. HOLY CRAP IT'S AMAZING!

Why am I so excited about the bun? Because it was incredible. It was fresh, it was tasty and it was toasted. That combination is lethally good. I ALMOST want to say it made the whole thing, but I think the toppings combined with the bun did it in for me. 

The funny thing is I used to not even really like dogs. I've always had them served to me very blandly. The only way I'd eat them later on in life is if they were straight off the grill. But now that there's all these gourmet offerings, I've tried my fair share of dogs around tahn. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this has probably taken over as my favorite. 

There's over 20 different choices of dogs, which is hard to believe. I kinda wanted to try them all, but ended up choosing the Illinois and the special of the day, the Arkansas dog. The Illinois (tomato, banana peppers, celery salt) had a bountiful amount of banana peppers and not too much bacon (which surprisingly, I liked). But I really liked the Arkansas dog (bacon, cheddar and scallions, horseradish) because of the horsey sauce on top and the. The prices aren't bad at all. Around $2.50-$3 for what I call a ""gourment dog"" is great!

I also tried the potato salad which had the right amount of mayo in it. It's hard to get that nice balance. But I will say, I enjoy a lot of it! Throw in fresh squeezed lemonade and I'm a believer!

Well, Lidia's, not Lidia the person. After a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good graces with their massive brunch spread.

I will give you ample warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap ton of food! And the best part? It's a bargain! For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Isn't that a bloody good time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me out afterwards!

The buffet is awesome, with tons of traditional anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty mussels. 

For your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, and rare it came out! It was very flavorful and I liked the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal to be on the menu, but it was delicious. I'd have to say even better than the salmon. I loved stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant (could you imagine the horror if they were instant?). 

With all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional tiramisu, which was fantastic! I like tiramisu that's not too espresso tasting and this was perfection. Very light and tasty. The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. Even better than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. But it would have been all worth it, I swear!

So heed my warning, friends! You will thank me as you're rolling yourself outta there!"

Good thing is it's set up like a tea room, so you can sit down and enjoy your tea with friends or bust out some work (yay for me!). It's really cool inside. There's little rooms you can sit in with a group of friends that almost look like it could transport you to a different country. Adorable, really!

There's literally a whole book full of teas you can order from. There's black, white, oolong, etc etc etc. Too too many to even name! I went with the Black Vanilla tea. It was delicious. Would have gone with a touch of milk, but I didn't know if it was ""proper"" to ask. 

They also have some very light snacks and desserts. I'm so excited to come back, I'm sure I'll get to the eats at some point. Although, I wasn't really a fan of the music. It was kinda like something you'd hear at a spa. If I had ear buds with me, I probably would have popped them in. But I get why they're playing it, for ambiance.

AND, now that their space is bigger, their menu is as well! Fried Avocado... may take the place of a fried pickle in my book. Delicious! Spicy gauc with yuca chips. Okay, pile on some more! They now even have bonafide entree items.

It doesn't get much better than this. But WAIT, it will... when they get their liquor license. I can imagine nights of margarita drinking on their patio (that I think they'll have down by their old location??). BYOB for now, so bring your mixers for their tasty bevvies.

The food is stellar! Still, after all these years (well, around 5 years at least). I have to imagine that one of the hardest parts of a restaurant going forward is keeping things fresh. Thankfully, they excel at this!

I love seeing all the special dinners they offer. I know... I have to get to one sometime. But in the meantime, I did get to try out their brunch for the first time and I'm here to report it is just as wonderful as the rest of their menu!

I love me a good prix fix menu and theirs is fantastic. For $22 you get a cocktail, small plate and entrée. As soon as I saw that I was in. Everything, of course looked great, but I'm a sucker for a good Salmon Eggs Benedict. I was stuck on what to order for the small plate, since the first think that appealed to me was salmon and I was already getting that in my main meal. 

My first order of the day was a spicy bloody mary. Upon receiving it, I noticed it had an overpowering taste. I was trying to place it and finally did. It had too much horseradish. I knew this because I made one myself the other week that I doused in way too much and it was not my cup of tea. I also didn't think it was very spicy. Even with a jalapeño floating around. Maybe a dash of red hot too? The server was happy to add some extra juice and that evened things out. Next time I'll know exactly what to order though.

I settled on the slaw dumplings on a whim, not really knowing what to expect. Thank God I did, because they were amazing! Crispy fried dumplings with a vinegar and tart slaw in the middle. They were piping hot, fresh off the fryer and I devoured them in seconds. It's hard not to go wrong with a small plate here, I've learned. But the funny thing is, it's not really a small plate. The server actually explained to us that a ""small plate"" is actually an appetizer sized portion, easily split among two people. Whatever, I would have been greedy with these delicious morels anyway. Best I not share. 

The eggs benny were a perfect size. Two buttery biscuits with fresh salmon, perfectly cooked eggs and a sweet hollaindaise sauce. It also came with crispy taters that weren't greasy at all, that complemented the meal perfectly. 

Considering this continues to impress me, I'm sure it won't be long til I'm back again."

I recently discovered their spinach and feta omelet, which I love, so I just health-ied it up with egg whites, whole wheat toast sans butter (because they tend to be heavy on the butta) and a side of fruit. And you know what? It was still tasty! I was even surprised how awesome the fruit was! It was a big bowl full of delicious banana's and strawberries! They also have turkey bacon and sausage. I was tempted to add that one, you know, for more protein, but I stuck with my little satisfying dish.

This location is very tiny, so I'd strongly suggest going during off hours. I've been during peak and you wait forever! Plus, there's very limited parking on the side of the building. And most importantly, it's CASH ONLY, with no ATM for a couple blocks.

I am a mad hotcake fan here, as the banana chocolate chip are my all time favorite. Trying to be ""good"" I opted for a spinach and feta omelet. I realized there really was no being good, it was bad, but in the best possible way. Follow me?

I mean, I always love the sweet stuff rather than the savory for breakfast, so omelet's are fairly boring to me. But this omelet was seriously so tasty. The spinach was incredibly flavorful and the feta was the same. Great distribution. The eggs were crisp, but buttery. Not too buttery, but buttery enough that I knew this was no healthy option. Oh well, it was delicious! I threw caution to the wind...

On top of that it comes with two pieces of wheat toast and incredible Lyonnaise
Potatoes, which I savored every. single. bite. of. I usually love crispy hashbrowns, but that isn't even a thought after biting into these taters. 

If you have a chance, avoid the weekend crowd, take a day off and enjoy a leisurely breakfast here during the week. It's definitely not half as crowded as it usually is. You actually just seat yourself! So treat yo'self with a cheat day soon."

Why not start off by talking about those delicious fried, cheesy, homemade sauerkraut filled balls! I could start a whole Schweaty Balls type commentary on them, they were that good.

It's no surprise, considering Butterjoint is connected with Legume, the equally as amazing restaurant next door. The bar is pretty much the same as it was before. Still dark, romantic and cozy, but with an expanded drink and appetizer menu. Brilliant move on their part because they'll attract people to the bar casually, then suck them in for the promise of delicious food next door!

For my drink I went with my old favorite, the Papa Dobé, which had Mt. Gay Eclipse Rum, Maraschino Liqueur, grapefruit and lime. I just can't get away from a drink with grapefruit. It's so refreshing, and this certainly did the trick. I also enjoy these well made cocktails because, although it's quite small, it's strong and meant to be sipped. Rather than a mixed drink thrown together at an average run of the mill bar that you suck down in five seconds because there's no liquor in it. No thanks.

We also ordered up the pierogie appetizer. Also, accompanied by homemade sauerkraut, which is the perfect blend of sweet and sour. The pierogies are made in house as well, and were crispy, but not burnt, filled with a potato and cheese blend that combined the best of two fine ingredients.

See, they hook you in. Because it made me think... ""Rachel, you must head back to Legume, stat!"" It did the trick simple as that, all it took were some tasty balls!"

You're pretty sure you're still going to like them, but something could go terribly wrong and you'll be disappointed at the hope of a long lasting relationship. 

Kaya is my go to joint for happy hour. Hands down they have thee best happy hour in the city. I mean, half off EVERYTHING! Even shots (okay, things get a little crazy when you enter that into the equation). And, of course, if you're drinking it up you also have to get some nourishment. Coming here so much, I've gone down the menu with my meals and not-a-one has let me down! All amazing... Big shout out to the Fish Tacos.

I'd heard how good brunch was, but I really wanted it to live up to the normal Kaya standard. You can see why I'd be nervous. If they ruined something as sacred as brunch, what would be left? Maybe I'm being too dramatic, because you know I'd be back at that bar once it hit 5pm, but still... I was expecting a stellar meal. 

I'm happy to report, they delivered, and then some! There were a handful of items that stood out to me, but the Salmon Eggs Benedict was the true winner. I believe the key item being corn bread instead of a biscuit. LOVED. IT. Every bite. The cornbread made the dish, but the hollandaise was a close second (you can't mess with a good sauce!). Eggs were perfect and salmon was smokey. The side dishes held their own with juicy sweet sauteed pineapples and a spicy potato hash. I really wanted to lick my plate clean. 

They can do no wrong in my book. Come for brunch, stay for lunch and exit after dinner. You'll probably want to throw up after a full day spent eating and drinking at Kaya, but it will have been worth it, I swear!"

I wanted to try them, considering I'd heard all this great buzz. In comes the bright, shiny new store right in the South Side. Lucky for us, we now have a city version of their eatery. Lucky for me, because now I'm addicted.

I didn't realize there could be so many waffle combinations. I honestly thought it would just be waffles with some fancy fruit on top or baked inside. But it's so not. It's pages of waffle inspired dishes! Savory waffles and sweet waffles, waffle sandwiches and so much more!I opted for the Eggs Benedict. Number 1, it's my fave breakfast dish and, number 2, I REALLY wanted the sweet waffles, but opted for a savory one (next time, my friends!). 

It was incredible! It had a lump of crab meat that was mixed with this tart, perhaps lemon (?) mix, on top of one of the best hollandaise sauces I've ever had (sweet). And the crowning achievement? The waffle itself! It was everything I THOUGHT a waffle should have been, but I'd never experienced before. The batter mix that created this square piece of magic was superb. It was sweet and fluffy, with no burnt spots to be seen. It was pure perfection.

I'm gonna have to fight the voices in my head each time I drive down Carson (to the gym right past the shop, no less!!!!) that tell me to stop in. But for you, don't wait, but run there!"

I say legit because everything here stands alone. Burgers aside, I've had a stellar pizza and now an awesome veggie Stromboli type offering that rocked my world just as much as the burger.

FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.
FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.

Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with ""Holy Oil,"" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! 

We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. 

We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!

For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!

Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.

For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.

Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. 

A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!"

The burrito... BIGGER! I inhaled a large burrito last night and was STUFFED. Could barely eat one Jamaican Jerk Wing. Jamaican Jerk Wing you say? Yep, they've added new items to their menu! And guess what? My burrito was shrimp! Exactly what I had wanted all along. They now offer a shrimp diablo and shrimp curry option.  My shrimp diablo was HOT, maybe not to the spicy food lover, but hot for the ""I like spicy food but it's hard to take"" spicy food fan. Plus, I could tell it was fresh shrimp and a good size.

And that salsa verde they serve? I could eat gallons! Still not so hot on the red salsa, but the salsa verde, a winner!

It's not just sushi though, it's everything and I want it well prepared and cooked to perfection.  So you walk into a place with the name ""Wholey"" and you expect it to ""wow"" you.  And you know what?  It did!

I was surprised to see the less than stellar reviews at first, but I had faith it was just the new restaurant jitters.  We came in on a random Tuesday night around 8pm and was surprised to see about 6 other tables full with diners.  Surprising to see in the Strip, but exciting, if you ask me!  

It's an absolutely gorgeous space.  Nothing you would expect from the Strip at this point and time.  It actually used to be a club, so there's many different levels.  I love the sea of blues and mosaic tiles.  The tables are large, so it's great for big parties.  

We started out with the Sashimi appetizer and it was so cold and fresh.  I loved the tiny mandarin oranges and crisp lettuce surrounding it.  We devoured it within 3 seconds of it hitting the table.  Good start!

The tomato salad will probably only be on the menu for a short time, considering the season for them ends soon, but it's worth having when you can.  You can easily throw together some tomatoes and splash on some balsamic.  This had a very well done pesto sauce and pine nuts.  I would have never thought of the combo together, but I loved it!  

I ordered the Scallops and Shrimp, which came with a hearty helping of jasmine rice and grilled bok choy.  Both the Scallops and Shrimp were seared to perfection and the scallops, which I find hard to season well, had a great flavor and were large in size.  I loved the creamy garlic sauce drizzled on top.  It was as if every element of the dish came together in harmony!  


While seafood can be expensive, and this was no exception for a $24 meal, I had no qualms about paying my bill for the amount of flavor that was packed into each dish.  Fresh is the word here and you won't have to reel me in... I'm coming on my own!"

First thing's first.  Everything on the menu looked awesome!  From the sammies to the salads to the sides, it was really hard to decide.  I'm a sucker for roast beef and horsy dressing, so I went with the Roast Beef sandwich.  It definitely held it's own with a nice amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and horsy dressing (I love me some sauce!) on a delish ciabatta bread.  

I also sampled the bean salad and pasta salad.  I LOVED the bean salad!  It was super tasty and had great flavor.  The pasta salad was bland.  I wouldn't get that again.  Only loser in the meal though... so I still left a very happy lady.

The bakery part of the deli looked incredible!  I could have gobbled it all up.  I, of course, had to get something!  So I tried the homemade s'more.  It was ooey gooey goodness!  I had my eye on a couple other items I'll certainly be back for, promise!

Although the line was long, it moved along fast and was able to zip in and out in no time.  This is such a great spot for a quick lunch, if I worked downtown I might be tempted to go in every day!  Another new establishment we're lucky to have in the Burgh!"

That sums up everything about La Gourmandine Bakery!  The delicacies in the case looked scrumptious, it's hard to choose one... so I choose two!  I bought the Délice de Pistache and Paris-Brest.  The Délice de Pistache is Choux dough covered with pistachio mousseline and topped with dark chocolate.  I had planned on only taking a bite.  That did not happen.  In fact, as soon as I took the first bite I was floating away towards the pearly gates of heaven!  It was just divine!  The Choux dough was light and almond tasting, the pistachio mousseline was fluffy and distinctly tasted of pistachio (I hate when fillings don't taste like what they should) and the chocolate just topped off my dessert decent!  

The Paris-Brest is Choux dough filled with hazelnut cream.  It actually looks almost like a doughnut.  It was the same heavenly taste!  They're actually very similar but different shapes.  The hazlenut again was distinct and the Choux dough was light with a slight crisp to it.  I would say my fave had to be the Délice de Pistache though.  But both were fantasmic!

I also grabbd a sandwich, which was very good as well... But I didn't want to mention that first because I was too excited about th desserts!  I had the Le Campagnard, which is a French baguette with mayonnaise, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese.  The baguette was incredible, and I don't normally even like them.  Too hard to chew.  Even though it was a baguette, you could tell it was freshly baked that day, so it didn't have that stale taste a baguette from say, Panera, would have.  I'm glad they offer lunch, because it's a chance to grab a quick sammich and bring home dessert for later... or stuff your face with it then!"

The Omakase tasting menu is either a seven course or eleven course dinner with dessert.  It's indulgent and worth every penny (at $85 and $130 respectively).  The plates served to you are small, but honestly not as small as I thought they'd be and the desserts, seriously, massive!  

We had the salmon tartare, sawara seared with hot sesame oil, fluke sashimi, black cod with miso, tuna shashimi rock shrimp tempura and an array of sashimi (toro, snapper, salmon, tuna and saward).  Honestly everything was fantastic and fresh, just like fish should be.   

Like I said, the desserts were all amazing and most of the choices were very rich.  I really enjoyed the chocolate maki and the inventive house made ice creams.  

The overall experience blew me away.  From the service, to the food to the atmosphere it's a perfect 5 star place and if you live here and haven't been, don't wait any longer!"

They've really got to impress me.  Even, let's say, razzle dazzle me.  Anyone can slap together two slices of bread, some cheese and meat.  But can it always taste good?  I'm afraid not.  

I'd passed Cafe Raymond a million times and never gone in.  It's just a small unassuming deli in the midst of the bustling Strip District.  But recently I kept saying to myself: ""self, you must go in there next time.""  That next time turned into today... And I was not sorry!

I'm a big fan of tomato and mozzarella salads, but I'm always hasty to order it when tomatoes aren't in season.  So I had to ask today, and the server assured me they were nice and fresh.  So I was super excited to order the caprese type salad.  All I said at the counter was ""tomato and mozz"" and I instead received a sandwich.  I'm not one to complain (too much at least), so I scooped it up and plopped down to mangia.

Good thing I screwed my order up because that ciabatta bread was life changing.  As soon as I bit in I knew it was freshly made.  I was confirmed by the nice worker, who said the owner Raymond freshly bakes all the breads except for the rye.  I'd eat those freshly baked loaves of bread to oompa loompa status if I worked there!  

Thankfully the tomatoes were fresh as promised, with the same fresh mozzarella and a delish grain mustard.  I can only imagine how scrumptious the other sammie choices are.  I can say confidently I will never be able to walk past Cafe Raymond again without devouring something inside... Maybe the whole bread tray..."

I tried a plethora of different ones but loved the buffalo, garlic and horseradish one the best.  I went home with the horseradish and have been happily eating it every day since.  Man does that horsey sauce give you a kick in the butt, but it's goooood!

I also had a gyro with all the fixin's.  The pita bread, soft and chewy.  The lamb, loads of it and nice and moist, no dry meat here!  The sauce (maybe to me one of the most important parts) was awesome!  Love me some cucumber yogurt greek sauce... load me up with it and I'm good to go!  Plus, it's cheap cheap cheap, with gyro's at around $5 and the hummus being around $3.  You won't break the bank with this lunch/dinner/snack!

It's a family run business and the owner is SUPER friendly and easy to talk to.  it's so awesome to see an owner that's so passionate about the business and happy to be there.

That sounded like it's my place, right?  It's not... but it IS my jam!  I will not mess around with this review.  Winghart's is still thee best burger in the Burgh!  Their meat is fresh and you can tell.  Their fries are spectacularly crispy and delicious.  But the new digs...

Gorgeous!  Just what the Market Square Winghart's so direly needed... SPACE!  It's huge inside with seating for what I suspect has to be around 80 people, along with a very long bar.  The beer offerings look to be even more wide and varied than the M2 location as well.  I do wish they would have kept Arsenal Cider on tap here, but I assume they rotate out, so hopefully it will be back!

One thing I will note that I like about the M2 location is that it's fun to sit right in front of the grill.  I like the cooks and staff at that location and it's fun to chat with them while they cook and see the ""process.""  I do miss that, but jeez, the SPACE South Side allows will be amazing for that crowd.  

I did hear a little secret on why their fries are crispy amazingness.  I guess they fry them twice in peanut oil.  And my secret, they have some fancy schmancy burgers (The Shipwreck is hard to avoid) but I keep it real with just a good old fashion cheddar burger because I actually want to TASTE the burger!  

So go here my friends and be merry and eat lots of meat!  Oh, their pizza's are bomb too:)"

What shall I choose from?  Buffalo chicken, tomato/feta/spinach, margarita, pepperoni and banana pepper.  Good Lord there's a lot of choices!  

I went with the margarita and tomato/feta/spinach.  I love how even though it may have been made a little earlier (okay, I hope a little early:/) they put it back in the oven to heat it up.  I recently went to a pizza place in Vegas that was rated pretty highly and the pizza was sitting out and kinda blah when they served it to you.  

I was a HUGE fan of the margarita pizza.  Let me preface this by saying I LOVE SAUCE, and LOTS of it!  This pizza was loaded with sauce and mozz cheese.  I was in heaven!  Even though it was NY style thin crust, the dough was a little softer than I'm used to seeing on NY style and I also like that too.  This was the winner for me!

The tomato/feta/spinach was a close runner up.  It was loaded with all the ingredients, which is a huge plus.  You don't want to end up with a slice of all cheese and a spec of the sides when you order a slice with toppings on it.  

Throw in fast and friendly service and a clean restaurant and I'm a fan!  I don't know if I can ever eat Domino's again... (maybe in a jam, let's not lie:)"

They just opened for lunch today and are running a special Lentin menu with fish, fish and more fish... And one burger (seriously, if you don't like fish or a burger you might be screwed till Easter.). 

I had the Parmesan fish sammie, which was a generous portion of perfectly battered fish, a VERY generous portion of provolone and tomato sauce. But the crown jewel was the smoked potato salad side dish. Again, generous portion of some of the most delectable and inventive potato salad I've ever had! The smoked taste stayed with me for a while after, but rather than garlic breathe, it was actual a reminder how, oh. My. Gawd. Amazing it was! To be continued...."

I tried to order the lamb sandwich but they were out, so it could have ended badly.  But don't you worry, they still had veggies, so I opted for the roasted veggie sandwich.  It. Was. Incredible!  I loved the soft doughy pita, the delicious perfectly roasted roasted peppers, zucchini and eggplant with a creamy saziki sauce. Of course, I also couldn't resist a beet salad side.  When you order a beet salad you never really know if you'll get (I mean, unless you read the menu...I just see beets and get excited!), greens and beets or just beets.  This time it was just beets, but it was still great with a slight taste of orange and vinegar.   

The place is super tiny, but wasn't too crowded.  The one negative thing was it was hot as hades inside.  I believe it was probably around 40 outside, so when I walked outside it was refreshing.  I even started fanning myself with a City Paper at one point!  

Other than that, killer meal and I will most definitely be putting this on my lunch rotation in Lola!"

I also love that I can grab a delicious, all vegetarian I might add, meal.  But don't worry, it's not shipped in, it's cooked fresh.

I loved how the soup had large pieces of fresh broccoli and it wasn't bean overkill either.

I am in no way a connoisseur of cured meats.  I actually wasn't fully aware of what the true meaning was.  As our server explained it to us, it's the process of using the entire animal for the meal and then curing it by adding spices, smoking it or preserving it for later in salt.  You could say I almost went into this blindly...but the other yelpers reviews don't lie!

We started off with two meat and cheese platters:
Salami -lardo, mortadella, pate campagola, ciccioli, chicken rillettes, cornichon, mustard, red onion, pickles and beets
PA Farmstead Cheeses - stone meadow, crottin de chevre, commonfolk, blue misty river, midnight dream and candied prunes

I was surprised to like the chicken rillettes the most (I'm not the biggest chicken fan).  It seemed to have the most flavor to me.  The mustard was AWESOME! I wanted to slather it on everything! I also enjoyed the homemade pickled pickles (heehee), beets and onions.  I really liked the crottin de chevre because I like hard and sharp cheeses more than the softer ones.  It was an awesome combo with the light honey drizzle and the candied prunes.  Can you believe I've never had a prune?  The thought of them scared me, but it was delicious!

Since I've never been to a place like this before I wasn't too sure what to order for dinner.  I just picked the meat I thought sounded best, which was the duck.  I'm not lying when I took my first bite and my first thought was ""orgasmic!""  Seriously folks, the duck was so tender and succulent with a crisp and incredibly well seasoned outside.  I had devoured the first slice of duck before I realized I hadn't cut off the fat...oops.  First thought was I should cut the rest off....eh...whatever it's all incredible, I'm downing the whole package baby!  

I also loved the spaetzle, melted cabbage, mustard and apple combo it came with.  I'm a huge cabbage fan and the flavors were just incredible again.  I would have licked my plate if I could, next best thing was leaving not a morsel left.  

The finale of our meal was the chocolate souffle cake with pistachio butter.  I will say, I do not usually like chocolate cake but this was again orgasmic and a total party in my mouth.  Just so moist with a perfect balance of chocolate so that it wasn't too rich.  And the pistachio butter, incredible!  Can I get that in a jar to go please?

It gets better though!  It's BYOB, so bring your fave bottle!  Reservations are a must, as it's a tiny place.  I have to also add that service was incredible and my water glass never fell below the halfway point.  The servers also were super descriptive with the menu and helped make our decisions easier.  I so appreciate good service...you could just tell they enjoyed what they were doing and were totally into the food!  I mean, who wouldn't at this point!"

I think the open fire place helped as well!  You really don't expect such a nice place to be in Oakland (sorry peeps, when I think Oakland, I think Hemingway's and dive bars). 

I don't mind the help yourself kind of set up either.  You gaze over the menu of delicious looking foods.  Decide what you want, which is, in fact, pretty hard with how amazing everything sounded.  I went with the Rocket Salad.  I was sold with the word beets!  I was also sold with the amazing sounding warm spiked cider on the chalkboard.  Okay, I'll admit it, I was also sold with the taters (because I had read the reviews already, which had stated they were delish!).  So, I pigged out.  Well worth it my friends!

The salad was really amazing.  It was a great spring mix of lettuce, a good amount of beets and a light sherry vinaigrette dressing.  I thought there was a little too many croutons and Chorizo.  But I loved the parmesan and sunflower seeds.  Overall, a win.  I also enjoyed the taters.  For some reason I thought they were going to be more like tots, but they ended up being more like homefries.  Now, if you like crispy homefries, you'll LOVE this!  There's tons of crispy little potato pieces amongst large chunks of taters.  I LOVE me some crispy taters, so this was totally fine with me!  I wasn't too into the curry ketchup, but I'm a 100% Heinz devotee, so this isn't surprising if you know me.  But they gladly brought me regular ketchup (I believe Heinz:).  

Speaking of service....I thought it was awesome!  I feel like when there's a help yourself service, you expect to be ignored most of the time.  But I think there was at least 4 or 5 people that came around to ask if we needed anything, cleared our plates and checked on us again, that it was incredibly impressive!  You will not be ignored!  

Oh, and my spiked cider, absolutely satisfying on a crisp winter day!  I loved the taste, the whipped cream and cute little cinnamon stick accent.  Love love love everything!

If not for the popularity, you'd never know it was here!  It's amidst a cute little row of houses.  When you walk inside it gives you a homey feel, since it's so tiny inside.  But the food packs a huge punch!

It's hard to chose what part of the day you should come here based on how great everything sounded from the reviews.  Since brunch wins me over most of the time, I chose that.  Good thing I was not disappointed in the least!

I love me a prix fixe meal because it offers a lot of options.  The prices for these are $19 and $23 depending on what you pick.  I chose the Eggs Benedict, Potato Strudel and Mimosa.  First off, the mimosa was slammin'!  They don't give you a dinky champagne glass, they serve it in a wine glass.  Total win!  Speaking of large and in charge, the loaf of bread my eggs and Canadian bacon sat atop was HUGE!  it was delish and most definitely fresh. The eggs were a fluffy-ness I've never experienced before and the Hollandaise sauce was light and abundant.  I need lots of sauce and it included enough for dipping.

The potato strudel was equally as yummy.  It's made with Parmesan sauce that is actually making my mouth water as I type this.  This should for sure be your side dish pic.  Although, I'm sure the other ones are winners as well!  

I will note that we didn't have to wait for a table at all, which probably had something to do with particular sports team playing at the same time, our win though!  Our server was incredibly friendly and helped make suggestions on different food items.  The meals came out super fast too.  I was really amazed at how smoothly everything was!  

We kept glancing over at other people's dishes ogling what their choices were.  I wouldn't say it was food jealousy, because ours was equally as fab, but everything that came out of the kitchen just looked so darn good!  Of course, I absolutely want to come back and try the mussels.  I will NOT wait too long again...see you there soon!"

As the reigning Pancake Queen (how did I get this title? I made it up!) I decided that I would do myself an injustice for not eating pancakes here.  Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed.  Not in the least!

The Oatmeal Pancakes with peach compote, pecans, powdered sugar and whipped cream was just divine!  I've never had oatmeal pancakes and I think I'm in love!  They were incredible and since they're made with oats I'm just going to go ahead and say they were healthy (they probably weren't, oops).  

We also decided to split the Omelet Ranchero.  It was packed with loads of cheesy flavor and a nice helping of salsa on top.  Served with potato's and we were in carb overload!  I almost wish we would have ordered a side of fruit instead of the wheat bread it came with just to redeem the meal into being slightly nutritional.  Whatever though, it was darn good!

The ambiance with bright walls, polka dots and fun modern artwork just matched the bright and cheery attitude of the wait staff.  It made me happy and most importantly, my tummy happy!"

The french toast is filled with lemon ricotta and bourbon spiked peach compote.  They were everything you'd want them to be and more.  Crispy on the outside, creamy dreamy deliciousness on the inside!  It comes with eggs your way and sausage or bacon.  Another mega plus....it's a Champagne brunch, YES!  You can also get a Bloody Mary....but I'm a fan of the Champage, so this was a no brainer for me!

Did I mention they also serve up some delectable pastries and fresh jam to nosh on before your food comes out.  I am ALL ABOUT the complimentary bread baskets.

I kept saying that over and over again as I was stuffing my face with the delicious food served tonight!  I swear to you I was so stuffed half way through my entree and I had to keep going because it....was...so...good....

The place describes it's dishes as comfort food.  I imagined the offerings would have a southern flair.  But the GM, Wil,l describes it as food that comforts you.  I love that!  It comforted me so much that I felt like I had to roll myself out the door!

I started with the Root Salad, which was a mix of red and golden beets, candied walnuts, goat cheese with sea salt and lime sprinkled on top.  Have I told you lately, that I love beet salads?  Like, so much!  It was incredible!  

My main dish was the Ricotta Gnocchi with peas, parm, mushrooms, cherry tomato and an egg on top.  I'm usually a fan of red sauce with my gnocchi, but this blew away any red sauce I could ever have had!  The gnocchi was just how I like them, like pasta/potato cloud puffs of amazingness.  All the ingredients complimented each other so well.  No red sauce needed!  The gnocchi comes from a local hook up, so you know it's not from the frozen section of your local Giant Eagle.  

The place is Incredibly intimate with seating for about 40.  Be sure to make a reservation because this place is going to fill up fast!  If you want comfort food style, look no further!"

I am ashamed at not coming here much sooner!  But in my lame defense, it's tucked away in in the back of Trinity Cathedral.  All tiny and unassuming.  Even when you first walk into the ""church"" doors, you have to ask yourself, am I coming here to confess some sins or eat some sinfully delicious dogs?

After reading through the many reviews on here I decided to opt for the ""healthy"" locavore dog.  It's awesome they carry this particular dog because it's made local AND doesn't have all those little mystery ingrediants that our other little dog friend has.  As soon as I read banana peppers I was sold on the Chicago Imposter gourmet dog.  It also comes with a whole pick, relish, tomatoes and celery salt.  It was really a great dog, although I still had to add ketchup, because we are in fact deeply in love, to the point where I have to add it to anything burger, dog, fry related.  

I was sad to find out they were out of their slaw because I'm a huge fan of the slaw, when made right.  I opted to get the Greek Salad instead.  Good for me they were out of the slaw because the Greek Salad was KILLER!  I had to ask if it was made in house and it in fact is made by one of the chefs there.  It comes HIGHLY suggested!  I had to carefully inspect the salad so I could figure out how to make it at home.  Artichokes, cucumbers, banana peppers, orange peppers, onion, tomatoes and olive oil....amazingness!  To be completely honest, I don't think I'd have been disappointed by any of the sides because I had to steal a taste of my friends baked beans and they were also stellar!  

Mega plus, they carry Boyle's soda!  I love me some Diet Cream Soda (I know...diet + hot dog = defeats the purpose).  AND, they give you a fun little gummy hot dog treat.  So freakin' cute!

Totally cheap option for anyone working/lunching or visiting dahntahn Pixburgh!  Then you can head into the church and tell God how thankful you are he created hot dogs.  Amen!"

Remember to keep an open mind and an open wallet, because you'll need it! 

First off, cocktails....hello! I ordered the Summer Strawberry and my friend ordered the Leven-ade. We were so confused because the waitress set them down in front of us and I had the yellow colored drink and she had the pink colored drink. We thought she had mixed them up.  But she hadn't.  I swear mine tasted more Lemonadie and tart and my friends tasted more fruity. So to solve that issue, we switched! And all was right in the world again.... 

I had heard over and over again that the portions were incredibly small. So with that being said, and not wanting to be a cheapskate by ordering only an app, I ordered the Asparagus Salad. The portion was big to my surprise...and utter joy. Score one! The asparagus was fresh and crisp with balsamic drizzle and pieces of thinly sliced pork (properly called Lomo...which I totally had to look up the meaning of, don't worry!) and parmesan. Perfection! 

I ordered the Tuna because I can rarely resist tuna if it's on the menu. It was perfectly cooked....or uncooked. There's really no other way to order Tuna then to order it rare. Go rare or go home! It was fantastic! It really out shined the mixture of rice below.  I also really liked the slight green olive taste in the dish. Score two!  My friend got the Hanger Steak rare as well and it was equal in amazingness.  I, of course, had to try it!   I'm a fillet girl all the way, but the way the steak was cooked made the flavor just right! 

So we left, empty wallets but full bellies. And I'm totally ok with that!"

In theory it sounds good. In real life I'll just drown any morsel of food I can into the chocolate and stuff it in! 

This is a special occasion restaurant. A special occasion where I have enough money to spare, because dear lord, it's pricey! 

The two greatest tips that they don't advertise: 

*Half off on Sundays from noon-3 PM. REMEMBER TO MENTION THIS TO YOUR SERVER! I learned that fact today when I got the shock of a full priced bill. I assumed they just took the discount off automatically, but apparently you have to tell your server as soon as you sit down that you want the half price meal. 

All Big Night Out meals half price = awesome deal! 

*Every day after 9 PM you can get cheese and chocolate fondue and a bottle of wine for $35. Serves two. 

The Big Night Out consists of your choice of cheese fondue (lots o' different choices of cheeses), salads (get the mushroom one), main dish (usually includes seafood and/or meat), veggies, potatoes and ravioli) and chocolate fondue (mmmmmm!!). 

You pick the type of broth for your main course. Usually there's one that complements meat and one for seafood. You're also able to mix and match your chocolate ingredients or choose one from the menu. I lurrrve the S'More's chocolate, it includes choco, marshmallow and graham cracker bits. And, ohhhhhh, the things you dip in the chocolate. Cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice crispies, marshmallows, banana's and strawberries. Seriously orgasmic!! 

They usually switch up the menu often so you can come once every couple of months and find something new. I also love the atmosphere. It's a great date night place or good for a group outing. The nice thing is that if you go with a group, you can choose a bunch of different cheeses, broths and chocolate to sneak a taste of all of them. 

Good thing for me that it is pricey. IF it was cheap, I don't think I'd like what the scale had to say after monthly visits to this place!"

I always love walking into a restaurant which looks super duper tiny from the front and then surprises you by being large on the inside.  The colorful pictures and art make it a bright and fun atmosphere.  Just like you'd expect from a 24/7 Mardi Gras party, minus maybe the flashing!

First time's a charm with this place!  Service was fantastic!  The server came up and explained everything to us in terms of drinks, apps and main courses.  Since it was for lunch I went on the light side with the Crawfish and Sherry soup and the Nola salad.  

The soup was delicious with just the right amount of kick for me.  Sometimes if things are too spicey for me I become a watery mess, and not in the emotional way!  I think the soup was just creamy amazingness!  

The salad was also very fresh with some great toppings such as candied pecans and my personal fav, little mini potato chips.  Of course the later mentioned doesn't end up making a salad healthy, but whatever, it was tasty!  For a final send off we ordered the fried artichoke's as our ""dessert.""  They were incredible!  Nice, crispy and huge with a spicy mayo type sauce.  I'm all about the sauces, so it was just the right touch.

I really can't wait to try out this place for dinner and/or a happy hour!  I will definitely be back.  I hope they have some idea's for events, because I think the place will be a great host for special parties.  Great addition to Market Square!!"

Need I say more? Ok I will.... 

The sauce also tasted delicious and definitely homemade. I was torn between getting the gnocchi or pasta vodka. I would have been totally satisfied with that choice as well. Thankfully, my friend ordered the pasta vodka and I ws able to steal away a couple bites of it. The sauce was fantastic! It was so creamy and had a hint of Parmesan cheese flavor. Cheese makes EVERYTHING better in my eyes (and mouth)! 

Our server was really fantastic and did a great job with input on our meals and also filling us in on some upcoming events. They're having cooking classes and wine pairing nights, which I'm totally into! Such a great way to get people in the door and eating, plus drinking!

The Strip District restaurant is pretty small so be prepared to hunt for a table at lunch time.  Be warned, I have been known to hover and pounce on a table if it looks as if they're getting ready to leave.  They offer up daily sushi specials which has actually made me branch out to try something different then my old faithfuls (spicy anything really).  There's also Taco Tuesday -  2 for $4.99, 3 for $6.99 or all you can eat for $8.99.

And remember, if you're ever there it's highly likely I will be too!"

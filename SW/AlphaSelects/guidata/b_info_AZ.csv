I couldn't wait to try Buck & Rider, and now that I have, I can't wait to return!  This hot new seafood centric restaurant has only been open for a week, but you wouldn't know it based on our experience.

My husband and I enjoyed an early dinner date night at newly opened B&R tonight and had a fun and memorable meal.  It's group service, but Mia was our main server and did a fabulous job!  

We enjoyed sharing the following:
-a half dozen oysters
-snapper ceviche
-lobster roll
-calamari

It was all fresh and delicious, and paired perfectly with the glass of wine (Domaine Serge Les Boursicote Sancerre) I selected.  It's worth noting that they also offer a solid cocktail list for all of you cocktail connoseiurs ;)

We sat inside but right on the border of the outdoor patio... We enjoyed an almost perfect view of Camelback mountain.  I say ""almost perfect"" as there is also a view of a Jack in the Box sign that gets in the way ;)

The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and classy, as is the architecture of the restaurant; all fitting of the inspiration behind the space; a house located in a swanky beach town on the Australian coast.

In addition to complimentary valet, B&R offers patrons LGO's signature sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out... it is the perfect sweet ending to your meal.  

For now B&R is open for dinner only, 6 days a week (closed Monday).  I hope they will extend their hours into lunch soon.  This is definitely a welcome addition to the 'hood!"

Yes, that's right... s.e.e.d. is my new obsession... I cannot get enough of their fresh squeezed juices, healthy snacks, salads and sandwiches.

I've lost count of the number of times I've visited, but it's definitely more than I can count on my fingers and toes, and I've always walked away a happy customer.  

Over the weekend, I had a big birthday celebration and invited some friends to celebrate with me at the Madison Improvement Club.  We did a #partyonabike (spin) class with Brittny, a private flow yoga class with Beri, and had lunch catered by s.e.e.d right on the patio.  It was perfect in every way!

I worked with Carly to plan it and she was OMazing... we ended up with the following menu for my group:

*1 hummus platter
*1 skinny dipping platter 
*1 Jaqlyn Salad 
*1 Kale 'em with Kindness Salad
*1 Santa Maria Platter (wrap style)
*1 Tune Up Platter (wrap style)
*1 What She's Having Platter (wrap style)

We also had juice shots (The Walk, Conquer the World, Zinger).  

Every single person I spoke to raved about the food, and I loved it so much, I ate leftovers for dinner... on my birthday!

If I could give Carly, Jaqlyn, and Chef Joe more than 5 stars, I would... Thank you for making me the most perfect birthday lunch, and you can bet you'll see me back at s.e.e.d. again real soon!"

This incredible bar/restaurant is literally hiding in the back of a shopping center, but easy to find once you know where to look... and for those that find it, you'll likely feel like you hit the jackpot!

Chef Cullen Campbell is known internationally and for good reason.  His creative menus along with cocktail creations from mixologist bartender Micah Olson are the talk of the Valley.  Now that I've been, I can say with confidence, that the Crudo experience exceeds expectations.  These local celebrities, along with Maureen McGrath Campbell (Chef's Wife) who runs the front of the house with ease, and the rest of the Crudo team have done a fabulous job with the space they are in.  I dined with a large group at Crudo last night and they took amazing care of us.  We had a cocktail paired dinner with three courses:

1st Course was Albacore Crudo with Green Apples, Black Garlic and Truffle Oil
*paired with Hophead Vodka, Damrack Gin, Celery Juice, Lime and Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao

2nd Course was Burrata with Marinated Tomatoes, Pimentos, and Garlic
*paired with Maison Rouge VS Cognac, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, Cardamaro Amaro, Grapefruit, Lemon, Luxardo Maraschino

3rd Course was Beef Brisket with Pork Sugo, Fonduta and Creamy Polenta
*paired with Buffalo Trace bourbon, Cointreau, Reagan's Orange Bitters, Sweet Vermouth

All of the courses were divine - I couldn't pick a favorite when asked because I loved them all!  The first cocktail was my favorite.

The atmosphere is welcoming and the space is gorgeous.  The staff is extremely attentive without being annoying: spot-on all around.  They also did a really wonderful job catering to the dietary restrictions that certain members of our group had.  We sat on the restaurant side, but the bar was pretty happening for a Wednesday night.

I cannot believe it took me so long to get to Crudo, but it's definitely going to be a ""go-to"" moving forward.  If you're considering going, make a reservation asap and enjoy!"

I don't get out quite as often as I used to now that I have two little ones at home, so when I do get out, I like to try new places.  Such was the case this past Sunday when my mother-in-law offered to babysit so we could have a date night of sorts.

Jared and I ended up at The Gladly for a very memorable meal.  Since it was a spontaneous date, we arrived here without realizing that it was Arizona Restaurant Week, but that being said, we received even more bang for our buck!  

We were super impressed with the remodel of the restaurant... it's got a great modern atmosphere with a fabulous looking bar, an elevated semi-private dining room and a more secluded banquet room in the works.  There will also be patio seating we were told.

Nathan was our server and he was friendly and attentive, as was the rest of the staff.  But the food was what really shined for us... Be forewarned, what comes next in this review is A WHOLE LOT of food.  We ate most of it too!  

Chef Bernie told us that ""people go bananas for the pate,"" and he was right... we dug in so quickly when it arrived to our table, that I forgot to snap a picture, but the presentation was beautiful.  It's served with toast, pickled onions, mustard and capers and the pate itself is in a small mason jar.  Next up, we had an order of the lamb riblettes.  I think these were the highlight for me... seriously amazing.  I'm still thinking about them several days later!  For our salad course, Jared went with the famous ""Original Chopped Salad,"" and I decided to mix it up and try the Roasted Cauliflower Caesar.  I believe both were smaller portions for the restaurant week menu, but they were still plenty big for us and we were happy with our respective choices - both fresh and tasty.  By this point, I was pretty full, but I made room for the additional side we ordered of brussels sprouts and grits.  Mmmmm!  My entree was the only thing that wasn't amazing.  I had the yellowtail and it was overcooked.  I probably would have sent it back, but I was too stuffed by this point.  Jared had the scallop entree and cleaned his plate!  Dessert offerings on the restaurant week menu were peach cornmeal cobbler and buttermilk bread pudding.  We ordered one of each and ended on a sweet note.

Just like sister restaurant Citizen Public House, Chef Bernie partnered with Andrew and Richie on The Gladly, and it appears they've done it again... another fabulous restaurant has been added to the Valley dining scene.  We can't wait to return.  I suggest you go as well; you'll be GLAD you did!"

I've been to this hidden gem twice so far and despite it being a tad bit out of my normal 2 mile radius, I'm sure I'll head back again soon.  I love that Bootleggers offers a very diverse menu.  When I went for lunch, I was wanting to be healthy and I ordered a kale salad with salmon.  The portion was huge, filling, and delicious.  The salmon was cooked to perfection.  In addition, there's a secret crunchy ingredient in it which I love - you'll have to go try it for yourself to see what it is!  

The next time I went was a few nights ago... it was date night and my husband and I decided to splurge and order from the not so healthy options on the menu: chicken wings (we went spicy on the wings, but there are several flavors to choose from), brisket nachos, and a burger.  We ran into some friends there that joined us and wanted to share, so we added two kale salads and a side of asparagus to get our veggies in!  It was all so good that we ate almost every last morsel between the four of us.  We washed it all down with a few beers.

I like the recently renovated prohibition ambiance.  (Ask about the wood used throughout the restaurant and the windows on the wall, which have quite a bit of history behind them).  Bootleggers also has friendly service from the hostesses and the wait staff. (Alex was my server both visits).  It was a tad bit slower when we were in for dinner, but it was also packed that night.  And finally, while I'm not a moonshine drinker, those that are will be happy to know that there is plenty of it to choose from!"

Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!

My favorite menu items are still the same too:
The artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!

I'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  

Service is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!

Of course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time."

For those wondering, my date was with my husband.  We left the baby at home (with a babysitter of course), and went out for a few hours to enjoy the beautiful weather.  After a stop at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market, we were both hungry and finally agreed to head to PB.  I hate to admit this, but it was my first time there... I had high expectations and PB delivered!  

We sat outside on the picnic tables instead of taking advantage of the full service inside.  We shared a tomato mozzarella sandwich and a tuna salad.  Both were delicious!  Melt in your mouth delicious!  We also brought home their market sandwich for our babysitter (aka my mother-in-law).  It was a vegetable sandwich which she said was delicious.

I'd heard the menu was limited, which it was, but there was still plenty to choose from.  I can't wait to return for lunch or dinner... and perhaps to take advantage of their private little room in back.  Anyone up for a little dinner party at Pane Bianco?!"

True Food Kitchen is by far one of my favorite spots in the Valley, and definitely my favorite Fox concept.  I was a huge fan before, but now with the addition of breakfast on the menu, I could eat at TFK for every meal and never get bored... 

While I have my favorite menu items for each meal, I do mix it up now and again.  However,  do not - I repeat, do not go to TFK for breakfast unless you are going to get at least one order of the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cakes for the table.  Served with pure maple syrup and Greek yogurt, this dish is a godsend from heaven!  

And while I'm here updating my original TFK review, I have to add that service is always fabulous.  Damon has a special place in my heart as he was my first ever server, and continues to be friendly and attentive when I get seated in his section, but I've had numerous other servers, and they've all been awesome.  I hope that the new Scottsdale Quarter location will be just as successful as this one.

Until next time, TFK - see you soon!"

We brought the wine (a bottle of red and a bottle of white) and my parents picked up the tab... such a deal!  We were seated in the back room - one I'd never even seen before... there was just our table and three other tables in the little room.  I convinced my mom to share the signature salad with me to start... and although Jared asked my dad to share the onion tart as an appetizer, my dad insisted on ordering his own.  (It worked out though, so I was able to take a few bites of the tart too).  For our meals, my mom and Jared went with the chicken, I had the salmon, and my dad went for the steak.  My fish was cooked just perfectly and served with an amazing butternut squash risotto and some green beans too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and despite the fact that we were all pretty full, we went ahead and ordered the mixed berry tart with four forks for dessert.  We cleaned that plate too.

Needless to say, we were right about my dad enjoying his meal at Coup Des Tartes.  We've always had great meals at Coup Des Tartes and we're sure to be back again real soon."

I had no expectations going in and didn't really think too much about a cake at all prior to today.  I didn't do any research, I just went with the flow.  Jared opted not to participate, so it was just me, my mom, and our wedding planner.  

I was super impressed from the moment i set foot in Julia's office.  Not only did Julia herself greet us at the door, but the cakes on display were like pieces of art!  I learned about her business as I admired the cake creations and luxury chocolates that surrounded me.  Not only was everything incredibly breathtaking to look at, but I didn't take one bite of anything that I didn't absolutely love!

(Yes - the wedding diet was on hiatus during my visit with Julia today!)

I sampled the passion fruit chocolate and it was amazing.  My mom commented that the caramel truffle she chose was like an orgasm in her mouth!  Then it was on to the cakes: we had the white traditional cake with raspberry gelee and swiss meringue buttercream filling and american buttercream frosting, the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache filling and chocolate ganache frosting, and the red velvet cake with sweet cream cheese filling and american buttercream frosting.  OMG - divine!  All of it! (And I don't even consider myself a 'cake person.')

I won't say which one my favorite was but I will say that Jared loved the same one I did when I brought him samples later in the day.  Our guests are in for a real treat...

Since our meeting, I did some research only to learn that Julia's sweet creations have garnered her notoriety as the ""Chocolatier to the Stars"" and singer/songwriter Alicia Keys has called Julia ""breathtakingly talented."" Among the many celebrities Julia has made chocolates for are Bono & U2, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Aniston, and Britney Spears.  None of this surprises me, other than not understanding how Julia keeps her girlish figure while she's surrounded by sugar and amazing fresh ingredients 24/7!

I am so excited for Julia to create our wedding cake!  If you're looking for a custom creation made with passion, check out Julia Baker Confections."

I must admit, Cibo impressed me more than I anticipated... even after reading the 100 reviews that came before mine!

I had plans to meet my friend and future yelper Leslie F for lunch on Monday, and when she suggested Cibo since it's near where she works, I jumped on it... after all, I'd never been and I'd been wanting to try it for ages!

Maybe lunchtime is the time to go, as we didn't have to wait for a table and our service was right on... Sara was our waitress and she was just the right amount of attentive; she gave us time to peruse the menu per our request but brought our iced teas out right away.  They stayed full too... thanks to the attentive rest of the staff.  I felt like I drank about 5 gallons of tea (it's really good by the way).

I opted for a vegetariano sandwich served hot with a house salad.  The saltimbocca bread is worth breaking the wedding diet for, and the grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella are just the right amount of flavor in between the fresh bread.  Each bite was uhhhmazing.  I love when restaurants choose not to skimp on the quality or the quantity.  The salad was the perfect compliment as well.

Leslie chose the Sicilia salad.  She is a Cibo regular but this was the first time she had this particular salad.  It comes with organic mixed greens, orange slices, goat cheese, and toasted almonds with Grand Marnier dressing and a side of fresh bread.  She seemed happy with her order as well.  The other salads and sandwiches looked appealing as well.

We skipped dessert although Leslie told me that the mini crepes they serve are fabulous... I'll have to return to try those as well as the pizzas one evening for dinner.  

I know Jared will also love the bungalow style house and laid back ambiance that Cibo offers in addition to the fabulous menu and service we received.  I can't wait to share my new find with him!"

It was a Wednesday night and we had 8:00 reservations.  We walked in right on time and were greeted immediately by none other than Eliot Wexler, himself. He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!

There were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!

On to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!

We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?

In some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as ""fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price."" I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.  It's worth dumping out your piggy bank if you have to though... it's a culinary experience you won't forget!

I'm already dreaming about my next visit!"

I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  

I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the ""Godfather"" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- 
dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!

Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!"

(It was a Tuesday and pretty happening there). I have to admit, I was kind of craving thai food, but I allowed him to talk me into it.

I'm so happy I did because:
a) it's always great to see Thomas
b) service was better than ever - Brian was our server and David brought our food out when it came
and c) I tried 3 menu items that I hadn't tried before and enjoyed all of them!

We started with the Fez lettuce wraps... I loved the balance of the chicken with dried fruit, almonds, and pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  Different any others I've had since they are usually with mushrooms, water chestnuts, and more of an asian flavor.

Next we had the kisra & hummus - I missed this at the Elite event somehow, but wow - it was delicious!  The garlicky hummus may not be so good for my breath, but it tasted amazing - I couldn't get enough!  The kisra bread was really good too - I ate way too much!

Lastly, even though we probably didn't need anything else, we had the shrimp, eggplant & mushroom kibis - I didn't realize they were fried when I ordered them, but what the hell, right?  A little fried food every now and then can't hurt!  Plus, anything with eggplant is tops in my book!  It is described as crispy roasted eggplant, mushroom and shrimp cakes with pesto herb aioli.  It looks like crab cakes, but you can taste all of the ingredients in each bite.  They were awesome too!

All in all, another fantastic ""Fez""tivity!"

I almost don't want to give 5 stars, just because they're a chain, but after my experience there tonight, I feel they deserve an all-star rating!

I arrived first (as usual) and put our name in (party of 4)... it was prime time (7:30 on a Friday night), so I expected a wait.  (They don't take reservations during dinner; only lunch).  I was given a beeper thing, and no more than 5 minutes later, it vibrated.  The rest of my party was not even there yet!  The hostess sat me anyways - there was a great table available in the bar area.  

Alicia was our server and approached me within minutes of sitting down to take my drink order.  I also ordered the artichoke appetizer for the table.  The rest of my party arrived and Alicia was back to take their drink orders. share the specials, answer questions, etc...

3 of us ordered the crab cake entree (2 with a side of broccoli and 1 with a side of honey roasted carrots) - and my dad had the halibut with fries... everything was delicious!  The crab cakes are not breaded at all; they melt in your mouth!  The broccoli is steamed just right and sprinkled with parmesan and some special seasoning that makes it taste great.  The carrots are sweet like candy.  I didn't have any, but the fries that came with the fish looked good too!

In the past, I've also had the Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip (served with warm tortilla chips and salsa), the Rotisserie Chicken Tortilla Soup, and several salads... I've always been impressed with the quality, taste, and serving sizes too!

I didn't tonight, but if you can - save room for dessert!  The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu, so they stand-out - for good reason!  They are all phenomenal!  My favorites are the White Chocolate Brownie, the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie with Graham Cracker Crust, and the apple pie a la mode!

Yes, the menu is similar to Houston's; yes, the bar is a replica of Ocean Club... but, the service and quality of WCG make this place unique and worth every bit of the 5 star rating I'm giving them!

EDIT: Service on a Friday night was not quite as great... I'll keep their 5 star review, but i'm rounding up now from a 4.5.  We'll see what happens next visit!"

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!

When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.

****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!

In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine ""Northern Italian Cuisine"" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!"

I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!

I've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)

I'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their ""Miso Hungry Salmon.""  

As mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!

If this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!"

I've probably driven by Breadcrafters over 3.000 times since I moved to Phoenix.  It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.

So, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!

Today was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.

If you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!

I was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!

I overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning... It may have been my first visit to Breadcrafters but it will not be my last.  See you there!"

Servers are consistently friendly and even when the restaurant is crowded, I've never had to wait too long on my food... 
Taylor's is good for groups but it works for solo diners as well... guys may think it is a little bit 'fru-fru' but they will not complain when their food arrives - indoor and outdoor seating available.  My next visit will be one night for dinner - i think they have live music from time-to-time."
